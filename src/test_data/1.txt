 I was very busy last week so that I didn¡¯t write anything. Because of the math class had been canceled, so I have some leisure time today¡¯s afternoon.
Half year had past in my college life, I realized that I have got close to the reality. I don¡¯t whether the change good for me. On the one hand, It makes me study much hard than before. On the other hand, it also makes me be afraid of seeking for the love which belongs to me.
I have read some books about philosophy and I begin to use the knowledge about philosophy to analyze some questions. Maybe college life changed my value about life in the half past year.
Someone says that seek your love no matter how weak you are. I really respect the people who were did like that. But I can¡¯t, I must care of my future, I must make me strong enough so that I can grasp anyone I love. But time is waiting for no man. I am twenty years old. I must hurry up.
I don¡¯t know whether my choice right or not. maybe ten years later I will regret for it. But now I think it is the only way I can choose.
What I am now. I am scaring to think my childhood¡¯s dream. I lose it forever. I know I can¡¯t realize it in my rest life. It only can be exist in my heart. what a pity.
It seems that I am a little negative. But to some extent, I really should back the reality. I must recognize what is my real life.







i was already 20 years old. study time in my life is not so much.i must  the seize the time.                                       
    recent years,i heared that  many of my brothers any sisters bought their own houses and cars .i feel strong stress that i have never felt before.it seems me began to miss myself.when i was young,i dreamed be an armyman.but when i was grown older.i found it is peace times.so i began to thought what should i do being a man.it's really a question.later i determined to be a politician.cxactly,in my senior life.but mow ,i am in college while i am puzzled.what should i do ,and how to spend my life .?i hope my life meaningful and influential.







i have saw my qq albums just now and different feels  arise in my heart. to thought my achievment last term,i can't diny that i have done something meaningful things. though it is so small that me couldn't aware it in my daily life.i have organised an activity .our class have made a big chinese map and this map just made of by many old clothes which presented by many graduates.we recruited many volunteers and we made up a bike team rode around the city.we narrated on the central street.isn't it very significative.
     many years later,when i am a geezer.when  i look back my college life .i'll appreciate it.







Today night, we had the first SX class. We all were shocked when we found that the new teacher was so young and just a little beautiful. but this time I don¡¯t want to talk about her beauty, I have a thought when her over her class.
   It seemed that she is very versatile and she told us much experiences. As a college student, especially an adult college student. I have my own sense. It seems she is very realistic. She didn¡¯t inspire us to seek our dream. On the contrary, she told us that we should recognize the reality and make the reasonable purpose. though it seemed a little negative and I also didn¡¯t agree with her. To some extent, she is right. But in my opinion, I think we should keep our dream and try my best to achieve it. We can not guarantee that the dream become the reality at last. But we won¡¯t leave a pity in my life.








Life is an indeterminate stuff, nobody knows what will happen in his rest life. It real gives us a big courage to fight and achieve what we want to own.
Today I have read the book wrote about Rockefeller who was used to be one of the richest men in America¡¯s history. it seems that he was a little mean. Everything about money is in his count.  But he really very   brave and can do everything what he has thought.
Just ask myself. Do you brave enough that you can try to do everything what you want? The answer is not certain yet.
Oh. Boy, look at yourself please. You are not handsome and tall, even you don¡¯t have a smart brain. Why you must be a versatile guy?
Because I never give up , because I am young and I have enough time to fight.
Oh, I see. Ok , you looks full of energy. I believe you.








Yesterday I had saw about my CET 4 grades. Fortunately, I had passed the exam. My grades just a little more than the passing grades.
Since the college entrance examination, I almost have six mouths never saw one word. And in my senior high school¡¯s English exam, I must try my best and then just got the passing grades barely. You can image how rubbish for my English.  I had passed the CET4, though I am merely the lowest grades in my class .
As a class council. I have made a statistic and I knew that there are also four guys didn¡¯t pass it . I know they just need a little fortune.
Though our major is not so well. I do believe all of us will be valuable.








Tomorrow is a special day. Because I will attend a job interview. This is my first time in my life.
I am in school so I can¡¯t go out to work to earn my pin money. Most important is this term I want to sign up for a second major course and I don¡¯t want to ask my parents for more money. So I get a job interview for the school part time job. To be honest, I don¡¯t have enough confidence for this job because I don¡¯t have such work experience before. even though, I want to have a try. I will try my best to fight for this job.
It seems like a battle. Oh, it is totally a bottle. what should I prepare for it. maybe I should write a perfect introduction and memorize it in my mind. Maybe I also should wear some austere and mature cloths  that make the interviewer feel I could shoulder this job. Maybe ¡­
Anyway, I just have a try. If I failed, I just treat it as a valuable experience for job hunting. Good luck for mtself.










A good now, all of my classmates will go spring outing this Saturday. i have hearted said that there isn¡¯t solidarity in our class. As the League Branch Secretary in my class. I have different ideas with them.
      We are college students now and all of us have their own ideas. Someone wants to build a huge relationship net. Someone wants to control the work skills. Someone wants to find a good partner¡­
       As time goes by, I believe that we will build a solid friendship for each other after three years latter. Why? Because we are classmates. Because we have lived together for one year and there are almost three years. So don¡¯t hurry.
