I agree with the statement that playing sports teaches people more lessons about the life.There are varites of sports, and each of them need special  skills and methods. For instance, basketball is a game which needs corporation of the team. Therefor, a successful basketball team does not only need the excellent skills of players, but also need corporation among the team. In other words, even if the players all do well themselves, but they could not be harmoney with others in the team, the team can not succeed. I think from this we can learn that communication is crital to basketball playing as well as our life.It is common when we start a new sport we find it funny and interesting. However, we may find it boring at a period of time, for we need to practice it again and again  in order to be good at it. Abundance of people give up at this point, only a few people persis on practice and succeed at the end. I think it is like other aspects in our life, such as our careers. If we can keep up to our choice no matter how difficult and hard it is, we can receive a good result.Take myself for example. I like to go mountain climbing. However, in the middle of the way sometimes, I offen feel so tired that I want to give up. Every time I tell myself to hold on and never give up. So when I get to the top of the mountain, I always feel pound for myself. Sometimes, I come up some difficulties in my life, when I want to give up, I will think of the process of mountain climbing, which will give me the courage to move on.So,yes,
