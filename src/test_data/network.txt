Bondi Beach has increasingly become a brand: beers, television and real estate agents use it romantically.

The real Bondi can be hard to discover, but that has become the job of Aquabumps photographer Eugene Tan. 

His shots have sold Bondi to the world more than a real estate agent ever could. His photography website gets 40,000 visits a day. Seventy percent of customers who visit his beach-side gallery are from overseas.

※The first thing tourists do is come straight to Bondi Beach,§ says Tan, who migrated from Perth 15 years ago. ※When I started living in Bondi I was quite overwhelmed by it.§

※They love the beach, they love the light," he says. "The beach is the focus of so many things.§

Tan has only missed three sunrises in the last 12 years.
And Tan＊s focus: he has shot the Bondi sunrise every day for 12 years -- excepting three days due to illness.
※So many people ask me if I get bored doing it, but every day is so different. The surf, the light, the weather and the people -- there is always something new going on. There are so many rare moments.

"It is like meditation for me: time alone with just myself and the ocean.§ 

In January 2004, Tan quit his job as a creative director with a web design company to focus completely on his own photography. 

Tan says the Aquabumps gallery business has been growing constantly, even in tough economic times. Which is a good testament to the popularity and appeal of his work.

Tan nominates his favorite photo as "Lone Swimmer," taken in March 2009 (above).

※I remember it so well. I was up in the helicopter shooting and it was a really busy day.

"But there was this girl just swimming out there on her own, enjoying the ocean on her own despite the thousands at the beach that day. It is special you can do that in a big city like Sydney.§

The 'workers' in Bangkok's fish spas do not bite into living flesh, but eat loose bits of dead or unhealthy skin.
Spa-goers in Thailand are sidestepping potential health issues to wallow in tanks filled with flesh-eating fish.

Rather than razor-toothed piranhas, the fish are tiddlers that simply suck up dead skin -- but officials in Thailand and around the world have warned that blood in the spas' pools could pose serious hygiene problems. 

However customers are continuing to patronize the fish spas, shrugging off any talk of danger.

"It is the same feeling like a mosquito biting you," said Lomporn Chintee, 27, after letting herself be nibbled in a "fish spa" on Phi Phi island.

"It tickles. I didn't know there was any health risk. But I'm not afraid. I would do it again.§


Charlie's Massage and Beauty on Khao San Road keeps thousands of fish in three rectangular, bathtub-sized aquariums.
In Bangkok, British tourist Clive Helman said he was intrigued by the idea.
"I would consider having it done if the place was pretty clean looking,§ he said. ※There is a place on Phi Phi where you could give the fish your full body, with no clothes on. I would start with my feet, though, and perhaps then give the full body treatment a go, despite the alleged dangers."

A fish spa treatment entails sticking your limbs or torso into a big aquarium filled with lots of small fish and allowing them to tenderly assault your skin in an uninhibited feeding frenzy.

The toothless fish do not bite into living flesh. Instead they suck and devour loose bits of dead or unhealthy skin, providing an aquatic exfoliation. The fish are believed to like dead skin because it is relatively easy for them to remove, especially after softening in the water.




















otees delight in the smoothness of their skin after spending 15 minutes or longer being nibbled while relaxing and keeping still, though the fish aren't scared away if customers jerk when they are tickled.


The fish at Charlie's Massage and Beauty aren't scared off if a person wriggles from being tickled too much.
Sounds fishy? Weigh the risks 

Some fish spa fans stricken with gout, psoriasis, eczema, bunions and other ailments have insisted the fish cured them, giving rise to widespread debate and online first-person testimonies about the treatment's benefits and dangers.

Most establishments throughout the world use toothless Garra Rufa, also known as "doctor fish," though some places describe their fish as toothless carp or Cyprinion Macrostomus.

Health officials in some U.S. states, however, have closed down fish spas after warning that customers with tiny cuts or wounds have soaked themselves in the fish tanks alongside other customers who have similar hard-to-see lesions, thus creating the possibility of receiving or transmitting infectious diseases.

Britain's Health Protection Agency recently announced it was investigating the possibility of human infection from fish spa pedicures, but had no confirmed cases of disease. Infected human blood can turn a fresh water aquarium into a potential mixing vessel. Pieces of uneaten, dead or diseased skin floating in the tank during the treatment add to the risk of additional skin diseases, according to health officials.

On the U.K.-based Gout Support Forum, one man claimed his crippling gout was cured by the fish, which purportedly sucked out the protein from painful uric crystals in his big toe -- but no one was able to confirm the fish's role.

Earlier this month, Thailand's Public Health Ministry advised people who have injuries on their skin not to use fish spas.


"If we see a little bit of blood, then they cannot go," says Pam, the owner of Charlie's Massage and Beauty.
That said, there have been no reports of any diseases transmitted by the 4,000 or so fish spas currently operating throughout the country.
"I have had this fish tank business for one year, and use black honey fish, and keep everything very clean," said Pam, who owns Charlie's Massage and Beauty on Khao San road in Bangkok

"I can use other fish, but I like these because they are strong and easy to take care of. They eat only a little fish food.  If I feed them too much, they become lazy and don't eat the peoples' skin.

"I have thousands of fish in these three tanks," she said, gesturing toward rectangular, bathtub-sized, aquariums where a cluster of foreigners were sitting on wood benches, dangling their bare legs in the lukewarm water.


"You can see the tanks have an ultraviolet light to kill any worms or anything else.  I change the water every day.  If I do not change the water, it will smell bad and the fish die.


















"We also check the person's feet before they go in.  If we see a little bit of blood, then they cannot go down into the water. Before they put their feet down, we must wash their feet first," Pam said, pointing to a plastic bucket, a pile of white wash cloths, and a smiling female assistant.

A French woman, offering her bare feet and legs to a shoal of nuzzling fish at Charlie's, said she did not know about the health warnings.

"I would like more information, because I care about this -- but when we go in the swimming pool, it is the same as being in water with other people," she said.

After being reminded that swimming pools use chlorine to kill germs -- which is impossible with the fish because otherwise they would perish -- the French woman watched the fish nibbling her and shrugged her shoulders. 

"I don't care."


There have been no reports of any diseases transmitted by the estimated 4,000 fish spas in Thailand.
Matters of size

Elsewhere along Khao San Road, the slightly more homely Club Fish Gallery promises 15 minutes in its tank plus a free cocktail for 100 baht.

Some sensitive people say bigger fish can create a slightly uncomfortable feeling if they have sharp mouths. Tiny fish are preferable, but the sensation can be like nudges from needles.

Using fish for medical purposes apparently began in Turkey, where some spas claim they can cure acne, eczema and psoriasis after lengthy, repeat immersions lasting eight hours a day, for three weeks.

One legend tells of a Turkish shepherd who rested his injured foot among some fish in a thermal spring, and soon discovered he was healed.  

Word spread and such treatments became increasingly popular in Turkey during the 1960s.

Today, they are big business at deluxe resort spas scattered across the globe, in addition to the cheaper treatments available in Thailand and elsewhere in Southeast Asia.













As some speedboat builders race to push the bounds of modern style, others are looking to the past for inspiration.
These six powerboats combine nostalgia with a distinctly modern technological twist.
Art of Kinetik Mazokist
Genetically modify a 1920s gentleman's launch, cross it with an early Riva runabout and give the designer a brief to fertilize it with some 21st-century shapes, and you have the 9.75-meter Mazokist, built in African mahogany and capable of 40 knots. Builder Art of Kinetik specializes in bespoke wooden yachts and promises no-compromise customization. The owner has a choice of different cockpit layouts, finishing materials and engine options -- even the bespoke steering wheel will be hand-finished. Each boat takes between six and 10 months to create.
Riva by Marc Newson












Successful industrial product designer Marc Newson has teamed up with Riva and its designers, Officina Italiana Design, to reinterpret the classic Aquariva speedboat. A limited edition of 22 was launched in September last year, available through that most unlikely of yacht suppliers, the Gagosian Gallery. New features include a redesigned transom, a wraparound laminated glass windscreen, split cabin door entry and separate driver's and passenger seats.
Yachtwerft Meyer 7.6 Meter
This 7.6-meter custom design open tender was built for the 60-meter Abeking & Rasmussen (A&R) Elandess, while the standard 10-meter version has been used as the tender for Aviva -- A&R's 69-meter, lauched in 2007. It is a beautiful example of the company's work, though it is not the solid wood that it appears to be: it is built using a lightweight fiberglass sandwich finished with a layer of varnished mahogany veneer. The sterndriven tender can reach a top speed of 34 knots.
Hacker-Craft Sport









For over 100 years, Hacker-Craft boats have been hand-built by craftsmen in America. Contemporary 21st-century versions have all that heritage above water but underneath, are utterly modern in design and materials. The 7.6-meter Sport is built with a cold-molded composite hull and finished with mahogany decks and trim. Every hull comes with a 10-year warranty. Propulsion can be petrol, diesel, hybrid or jet-drive, with many options available.
Scalar-Speedster
The Scalar-Speedster is a classic motor boat in varnished mahogany and teak, hand-built to order by expert craftsmen, with fittings and equipment customized to each owner's specifications. The Henningsen & Steckmest yard has been building boats for over 50 years. In 1973, yard owner Rolf Steckmest established Scalar Yachts as a separate brand and recently designed the Scalar-Speedster.
J-Craft Torpedo
The J-Craft Torpedo is a blend of classic style with modern technology from a yard that boasts a long heritage in building robust boats that suit the rugged and beautiful Swedish coastline. For the hand-built 12.6-meter Torpedo, J-Craft has taken its inspiration from the Riviera of the 1950s: it's relaxed, cool and confident. IPS power delivers over 40 knots.











The move means Amazon is officially "to the cloud" with music -- beating Apple (AAPL, Fortune 500) and Google's (GOOG, Fortune 500) years-long attempts to do the same.

Analysts say that's because Apple and Google have been waiting for record labels to get on board with licensing agreements. Amazon decided to skip the niceties and simply take the plunge.

"For Amazon to try to sidestep all of this, the consequences are a big question mark," says Paul Verna, senior analyst at eMarketer. "It's the first shot across the bow, which is refreshing, but you can smell the lawsuits coming."

Indeed, a Sony Music spokeswoman said Tuesday that the company is "disappointed that the 'locker service' that Amazon is proposing is unlicensed by Sony Music. We're hoping that they will resolve the situation by moving to a licensed model. We are keeping our legal options open."











Cloud music services are "sort of a legal gray area," Verna says. "Music licensing rules are arcane, and [labels] don't yet know how to handle the cloud. Amazon has leapt to the front of the line, but this is not going to be a smooth ride."

Music streaming services like Spotify have grown rapidly in Europe thanks to simpler licensing rules -- but they can't crack the U.S. market.

The problem is that technology is evolving faster than business models. Major music companies have been slow to embrace streaming or subscription models because the monetization plan isn't clear-cut -- and they think they're not getting the appropriate value for each piece of content.

To the cloud! Wait, the what?
"Streaming music through the cloud doesn't conform to their traditional view of a product; this is something entirely different," Verna says. "And if Apple and Google are waiting for record labels to come on board, it might be an endless wait."




















Indeed, the two companies have sat on their music-in-the-cloud acquisitions, while the labels drag their heels. Google snapped up iPhone streaming music app maker SimplifyMedia last year. Apple bought Lala in late 2009 and shut it down a few months later.

Amazon's iron-clad infrastructure
Amazon has another advantage in the race to the cloud: Indomitable infrastructure.

While Google and Apple are working quickly on the back-end technology to support music in the cloud, Amazon has spent years creating and refining an "elastic" model called EC2.

EC2 is designed to scale up automatically to handle giant traffic spikes -- the kind Amazon gets every year during the December e-commerce rush. The company has so much spare server capacity, in fact, that it enjoys a revenue stream hosting other websites, including the parts of The New York Times, Second Life, the Indianapolis 500 and the Washington Post.

"The EC2 service is the poster child for this kind of technology," says Chris Weber, managing partner at security outfit Casaba LLC. "There are competitors out there, but Amazon has a massive jump on it. Every new startup uses EC2 to get going."





















Weber says Amazon's free 5GB of storage is a smart way to "rope people in. We have so many gadgets now, and it's solving a real problem. Once you're in the cloud, why would you want to move all your data around manually?"

If Amazon's Cloud Drive takes off, the company will be well positioned in the digital content space. It's made multiple media announcements in 2011 so far -- including its own Android Appstore and an instant movie and TV show streaming option for Prime users.

Verna, the eMarketer analyst, thinks Amazon is trying to put itself at the vanguard as media moves from physical to digital goods.

"Amazon positioned itself as the go-to place for deals on physical products," he says. "They need to continue to be a one-stop shop for books, movies and TV -- and as those products become digital, Amazon will have to evolve along with them." 











Anyone walking back from church in Brampton on Sunday, June 16 1667 may have looked over a hedge and seen Samuel Pepys＊ wife, Elizabeth, and her father-in-law, John, digging furtively in the garden.
They were burying the gold of his son, Samuel, which they had brought from London in a night bag on a coach the previous Thursday. Pepys, then Surveyor General of Victuals for the Navy, had been keen to evacuate his wealth on hearing the news that the Dutch Navy had seized an English warship, the Royal Charles, at Chatham and were on the point of sailing up the Thames to seize London.
Pepys wrote in his diary of his father and wife＊s mission to hide the gold: ※Pray God give them good passage, and good care to hide it.§
The Cambridgeshire property called Sycamore Farm, but now known as Pepys House, was Pepys＊ house in the country. He coveted it from a young age 每 he may have lived here while he was attending Huntingdon Grammar School in the 1640s.
Upon his uncle＊s death, it passed to Pepys＊ father and was later inherited by Pepys himself. He often talked of retiring to Brampton, but it does not seem that it ever became his permanent home.














We have had some extensive re-plumbing work on our Fifties semi. Copper pipe is apparently getting ※as expensive as gold§, so the plumber used plastic pipes in several locations. Different types and colours of pipe were used, also push-fit connections, some of which resembled ※hand tight§ compression fittings. Are there pipes for particular jobs, such as ※blue§ for mains and underground water? And are these push-fit connections reusable? AW, Chessington
A The price of copper has certainly gone up over the past few years but is, of course, nowhere near as expensive as gold. Over the past 12 months the cost of 15mm copper tube has risen from ㏒2.10 to ㏒2.60 per metre 每 a 24 per cent increase. However, in that same period the price of 15mm plastic (grey polybutylene) pipe has risen from 92p to ㏒1.52 每 a 65 per cent increase.
The fittings for plastic pipe are much more expensive, however. A straight 15mm coupling (to join two lengths of pipe) costs 11p in soldered copper compared to ㏒1.30 in plastic. The figures for a three-way T-fitting are 62p versus ㏒2.30 each. So, depending on the number of fittings, plastic can work out as or more expensive than copper. The savings are in the labour, which your plumber might not have passed onto you.
Regarding types of plastic pipe, blue MDPE (polythene) is used for below-ground water mains, and polybutylene (either grey or white) is used for hot and cold water and central heating. PE-X (cross-linked polythene 每 white) is claimed to be more flexible and to have a longer life expectancy (in excess of 25 years) and ※barrier pipe§ incorporating aluminium sandwiched between two layers of PE-X or polybutylene is becoming popular in central heating to prevent oxygen percolating through the pipe wall and corroding metal components in the boiler, which seems to be an increasing problem.












Sculpture is hot news. The Royal Academy＊s current show, Modern British Sculpture 每 the first on the subject for 30 years, is whipping up controversy. A collection of virtually unknown Barbara Hepworth pieces, gifted by the Hepworth Estate, is generating excitement around the Hepworth Wakefield, an art gallery opening in the sculptor＊s home town in May. Meanwhile garden exhibitions nationwide, including the Chelsea Flower Show, will highlight the latest designs incorporating sculpture.
Many gardeners welcome the visual foil that a well-chosen sculpture provides. Some enjoy the contemplative aspects that a thoughtfully placed piece can bring. However, it＊s a thorny subject for purists who see little need for non-naturalistic intervention in a garden. And, admittedly, too often there＊s an aesthetic gap between artistic show garden sculptures and designs used domestically (leaping leprechauns, anyone?).
The shape of things to come
Designers do agree, however, that the relationship between shape and location is key. ※You can＊t place a sculpture anywhere 〞 it needs to resonate with its surroundings,§ says Cleve West, who is creating the Telegraph＊s Chelsea show garden. He cites a scheme for a client in Normandy where he contrasted big, simple shapes 〞 steel pyramids and spheres 〞 with wild planting in a large garden surrounding a rebuilt farmhouse. ※The forms were quite stark but created a dynamic that enlivened the garden and related to the architectural austerity of the house,§ he says.


















Our flat has been invaded by snobbish mice. The only thing that will tempt them into the trap is a piece of Prince Charles＊s Duchy Originals oaten biscuit. So, not only snobs, but organic snobs as well. They spurn chocolate buttons 每※My dear, not even Fairtrade§ 每 and they turn up their whiskers at cheese 〞 ※such a clich谷§.
It＊s a ※humane§ mousetrap which is a misnomer; it should be called ※the trap for squeamish people§. It＊s really for our benefit, not that of the mouse. When you catch one of these pesky rodents you are then supposed to get miles away from home before you release it, or else it will come scampering back after you for another oaten biscuit.
I thought I really ought to take my mice to Highgrove so they could be among their own kind, because those mice are so posh that some of them will almost certainly be going to the royal wedding.
Instead, I released three of my captives in a park and I let out a fourth in the street next to a post where there was a sign appealing for information about a missing cat. You never know, there might be an interesting reunion.
The fifth mouse was a maverick. For several nights it mystified us with its rustling in the kitchen. Then, just before going to bed, I realised it had climbed into a packet of flaked almonds, where it was guzzling happily.



















With all due respect to your other advisers, you certainly seem to be describing shin splints. However, this type of lower leg pain brought on by exercise has more than one possible cause and this may be where there is room for uncertainty about trying to explain the problem.
The muscles attached to the front of the shin bone (tibia) are those that raise the foot and toes. Inflammation of these muscles, possibly initially from overtraining, may grumble along for ages as most people who take exercise regularly don＊t want to be told to take it easy and therefore may find it hard to truly rest the muscles long enough to let them recover.












An exquisite line-up of rare and beautiful cars old and new, stunning lakeside surroundings, fine cuisine 每 all set against the backdrop of a grand house. It can only be the annual Salon Priv谷.
Now in its sixth year and billed as "The Luxury Supercar Event", it promises to be the biggest Salon Priv谷 yet, boasting more premium marques and the largest and most valuable collection of modern and classic supercars and luxury brands to date. There's even a 10% discount for Telegraph readers.
Guests who have attended previous Priv谷 events are promised a number of exciting changes, not least the relocation of the three-day extravaganza from to the spacious, 200-acre grounds of Syon Park, the imposing London home of the Duke of Northumberland.
Also new for 2011; the event 每 for which Telegraph Motoring is the official media partner 每 is moving forward to June 22-24, placing it right in the middle of the UK summer season events calendar. Visitors will also be able to get some hands-on experience in some of the cars, at the invitation of manufacturers.
"We're thrilled with the success of Salon Priv谷 to date and remain committed to expanding and developing it, but without losing the fundamental exclusivity and intimacy that has made it so popular and so well established," said Salon Priv谷 co-founder, David Bagley. "As testament to this, we're delighted to welcome so many new brands to Salon Priv谷 for 2011."













As any parent of a teenager will attest, getting them out of bed much before midday on a weekend is something of an achievement. Yet every Sunday without fail, come rain, shine, snow or hail, Roarke Hughes and Niall Watson, two 14 year-olds from Fife, are pedalling around the streets of St Andrews by 10am, collecting rubbish for recycling and selling their free-range chicken eggs in a business they call the Re-Cyclists.
Since they started 每 to raise money for a school trip three years ago 每 they have collected thousands of bags and saved thousands of tons of rubbish from ending up in landfill.











Earlier this month, they were the youngest finalists at the first ever ※Green Oscars§, the PEA (People and Environmental Achievement) Awards, rubbing shoulders with organic chocolatiers and green inventors. Their parents are naturally, very proud of them. ※It＊s not exactly the south of France up here,§ says Roarke＊s father, Justin Hughes, ※but we rarely have to prod them to get out of bed.§
Niall＊s idea for a green business came after a school environmental project, and the need to raise money for a camping trip. ※I wanted to do something to help with global warming so I thought about collecting recycling rubbish as the council only collects paper.§
Niall and Roarke charge ㏒1 a bag to collect waste from households in St Andrews, which they place in their bike trailers and take to the local recycling centre to sort out. Niall needed to raise ㏒150 for his school trip but quickly raised ㏒200 and realised he was onto a winner.















※When we started, we collected about 500 bags in the first year,§ says Roarke, who, like Niall attends Madras College in St Andrews. ※We now collect between 1,200 and 1,400 bags a year. Sometimes I can spend the money, but most of the time Mum makes me save it.§
With ㏒2,000 saved already, by the time they leave school they may well be the only 18 year-olds in the country who are able to afford a place at university. The pair sort plastic, cardboard, old children＊s toys, unwanted books, some electrical equipment, separating out clothes and usable books for charity collecting bins.
Although both are young, they have astute business heads, but are determined that their knack for clever ideas does not interfere with their environmental credentials: ※All our business ideas are green,§ says Niall, ※I never want to make money without combining it with a green philosophy.§
After winning ㏒2,000 in a green children＊s award last year, Roarke and Niall invested in chickens, coops, new bikes and trailers. They sell free-range eggs, at ㏒1.50 a box of six, which they transport in backpacks.



















※I used to have eight chickens, but a fox took one,§ says Roarke, who lives in an old mill house by the side of a burn in Dura Den. When the hens are laying well, the family is allowed to have a few freebies 每 but in the main the eggs are for paying customers only.
In their latest venture, the pair have invested in six aluminium can collecting bins, which they have supplied to pubs and hotels for free. They then collect and crush the cans to sell them on. Aluminium cans sell for between 40 and 45p a kilo and with roughly 60 cans making one kilogram, it＊s clear that the boys＊ latest idea has money-spinning potential as well as being a community asset.











Roarke and Niall are just two of a growing movement of environmentally conscious teenagers that are forcing their parents＊ generation to change their habits.
In a survey recently conducted by National Ethical Investment week, 24 per cent of adults questioned said their children were a key influence on their environmental decisions. Just two per cent said politicians influenced them.
That said, Greenpeace has a much younger membership than other charities such as Oxfam or Guide Dogs for the Blind, signalling where young peoples＊ concerns lie.
Roarke＊s father says the combination of healthy outdoor exercise, the social aspect of the business 每 many of the boys＊ customers are elderly 每 and the disappearance of traditional youth activities such as scouts or paper rounds means that Roarke and Niall are plugging a widening gap. ※This is surely what Cameron＊s Big Society is all about,§ he says.












The Kia C'eed is the car that makes your cash go furthest according to a new award.
Run by Parkers car-buying guides and assessed by the organisation's "Cost of Motoring" tool, it was announced that the C'eed gives best overall value when hidden costs such as depreciation, showroom tax, first registration fees, service and repairs, road tax, fuel breakdown and even breakdown costs are taken into consideration.
The awards celebrate a mix of value and premium brands across 11 categories, and included in this year's winners are the Renault Twingo 1.2 16v Bizu (best value city car) and the Audi A1 1.6TDi SE (best small hatchback).
In the Sports and Premium Executive categories, accolades have been awarded to the VW Scirocco 1.4 TSi 122 and the BMW 520d SE, because both offer drivers "superb value for money".
"It is great to see some truly outstanding cars winning our Parkers' New Car Awards 2011," said Kieren Puffett, editor of Parkers. "These awards will help thousands of consumers to immediately identify and shortlist the cars that make their cash go further".











I have lived in this pre-Victorian flat in south London for 20 years. The room we use the most is the kitchen, but the dining room is for intimate gatherings with the family and friends. It is inspiring to use antiques more for entertaining, to actually eat off them. You can build a story around them 每 they provide a form of escapism and are evocative. I have an old collection of plates from my grandmother which I rarely bring out for food, but when I do, I know that she would have been pleased that they are being used.
They bring back memories; I still remember the fantastic rabbit in pastis dish she used to make. I can understand why people are scared of eating off them, but antique diningware was built to last.
It is like fine wine; winemakers would be very upset if they thought their wine was being used solely as an investment. Of course, you have to be more careful 每 you can＊t put antique plates in the dishwasher or use a scourer!










If David Cameron went down to the woods today 〞 well, the surprise wouldn＊t actually be that big. As he will have realised following the outcry over the Government＊s plans to sell off tracts of Forestry Commission land, woodlands have a particularly special, fiercely protected place in the British heart.
It＊s not just about the freedom to ramble about in shady dells and silent forest floors, though of course that is very important. It＊s more to do with how, on some extraordinary level, forests chime deeply in the national subconscious. For many centuries, they have coloured enduring myths and stories.
From the medieval alliterative poem Sir Gawain and the Green Knight to the legend of Robin of Sherwood; from the mythic figure of Herne the Hunter to Shakespeare＊s Forest of Arden, woodlands have been perceived as having a faintly magical, almost anarchic quality. The laws of the town and the laws of the forest do not match. The forest is a realm of wonder, where anything seems possible.
That goes as much for the enchanted characters in A Midsummer Night＊s Dream as it does for Winnie the Pooh in the Hundred Acre Wood.
Even in real life, some of Britain＊s beautiful ancient forests have curious, almost preternatural reputations.













The Forest of Dean 〞 recently in the foreground of the forestry sell-off protests 〞 was described by one of the area＊s sons, playwright Dennis Potter, as occasionally having a sense about it of ※an old and unknowable fear＊＊.
Balancing this, however, is the sheer swooning beauty of this old wooded mining landscape, described by another writer as an ※independent state between the Severn and the Wye＊＊.
Some say that Britain, until the Middle Ages, was absolutely covered with woodlands, before the Tudors and Elizabethans started felling timber in vast quantities, not only for fuel, but also to construct a navy.
Others suggest that grave tree loss was taking place as far back as the Bronze Age thanks to the inroads made by Neolithic man. Whatever the truth, our surviving ancient woodlands need cherishing.













The Costa prize-winning poet Jo Shapcott recently told me: ※There is nothing human about trees. They have a life we can＊t have, a field of sensation we can never understand.§
And you don＊t even have to go that far out into the wilds to find these venerable trees.
Londoners, for example, can simply take the Central Line underground to Loughton, walk for 10 minutes and find themselves in Epping Forest, among trees that Queen Elizabeth I would have seen.
There are other sorts of woodlands: those on hills that command swooping views, and those that wind and track down into secret, lush valleys. Never mind about ※biodiversity＊＊ (an ugly modern word for an ancient beautiful thing).
This half-term, the best way to enjoy woodlands is not to tick species off a list; just go, and walk quietly, and look about, and absorb the sense of wonder, and of age.












My heart sank when I heard about Channel 4＊s Love Thy Neighbour. There＊s a ㏒300,000 cottage in an idyllic village to be won by one of 12 families, in a knock-out contest to be decided by the villagers. You just know that this will be taken by the producers as an opportunity to probe the gulf that has developed between town and countryside in modern Britain. The one is fast-moving and diverse, the other has been lovingly crafted into a retirement dream of teashops and unblemished views, where a niqab is rarely seen. True to expectation, the village, Grassington, in the Yorkshire Dales, is a place of almost impossible perfection, and one of the families in the first episode is black.














But as I watched, I became engaged. To begin with, I found myself squirming with embarrassment for the villagers, who 每 having been little exposed to ※difference§ 每 don＊t have the language of political correctness at their command. Few black people make their homes in pretty English villages. If they did, I＊d like to think they＊d find a welcome; but I know pockets of prejudice still exist. The black family are Phillip (whose roots are Nigerian), Simone and their three children. The phrase often used to assess an offcumden, or newcomer, is: ※Does his face fit?§ If the face is Nigerian, it might struggle to, in a community that appears to be 100 per cent white.














But then, what did Phillip and Simone think they were doing, coming with their urban ways and expecting to make a hit with a bunch of doggy, hill-walking country folk, for whom the city is a fearsome and chewing-gum-littered place? I＊m pleased to say that both stereotypes were confounded by a programme which was far more nuanced 每 and intriguing 每 than I＊d expected. Phillip turned out to be an aspirant Conservative MP, who might have been an advertisement for David Cameron＊s Tory party.
Against them are Steve and Nicky, he originally from Yorkshire, she from Birmingham. They＊re looking for a ※fresh start§. One family will be voted off at the end of the programme. Next week, two lesbians wanting to have a baby, and an artist＊s life model from Glastonbury: who＊d have thought it?










Ultimately, Grassington will have to live with its choice. And what will the winners make of their new home? The stuff about not belonging to the village until you have three generations buried in the churchyard is nonsense. That may have been true a century ago, when people lived and died where they were born, but not now; the transformation to have overcome villages in the last 50 years is immense 每 there＊s running water for a start. Grassington, rose-bowered now, was built to house lead miners: don＊t tell me it hasn＊t changed. But in such a beautifully manicured place, new blood runs in old veins.












Unwanted two-legged visitors have also been busy. Dave at the Hoops, the village＊s traditional pub, has had 25 of his prize-winning Partridge Wyandotte bantam pullets pinched; the cockerels were left behind. He hasn＊t seen a policeman yet but he has been offered ※counselling§. If I was offered proper policing or ※counselling§ I know which I would choose.
A four-legged visitor arrived on the farm, too, in broad daylight, leaving behind the smell of creosote and vinegar, plus a pile of hen feathers. I hope the fox doesn＊t make it a habit.
By coincidence, on the same day I met Janet and Ron Graham from a neighbouring village. Janet and Ron are special people 每 their cockerel was declared a ※statutory nuisance§ by South Cambridgeshire district council in 2005. The legal threats from the council came after one complaint, from a long-standing next-door neighbour who suddenly decided to put his house on the market. In spite of a petition from other neighbours, who liked having the poultry as part of village life, the ※statutory nuisance§ was declared.













After Ron and Janet spent nearly ㏒2,000 trying to defend themselves, and their cockerel, they decided that the amorous bird had to go, along with their geese and ducks. The next-door house was sold, the advising estate agent was happy and new neighbours moved in.
Then last summer a miracle happened. One of Janet and Ron＊s hens secretly brought off a brood of chicks and one happens to be a cockerel. When I saw them, he was crowing merrily and the neighbours on both sides are happy.












On warm nights in March the first moths are on the wing. They are often found at rest in the morning where a porch light has been kept on. Some have delightful seasonal names: the Spring Usher, the Early Moth and the appropriately named March Moth.
Everyone loves butterflies; but their darker and more numerous relatives are catching up in the nation＊s esteem. ※Nearly every county in Britain has its own moth group,§ says Richard Fox, a moth specialist at the Dorset-based charity, Butterfly Conservation. About 5,000 volunteers, from the Channel Islands to Shetland, are recording these secretive creatures of the night. To lure them they use lamps, alcoholic treacle or ropes dipped in wine. Moths Count, as the project is called, has turned in about 11 million records in the past 10 years. Fox calls it ※a fantastic effort and a triumph of citizen science§.















As a result it is possible, for the first time, to map accurately the distribution of all 868 of our larger moths. And what a tale the maps tell. Some moths are widespread; others may be confined to natural habitats, such as coastal dunes or heaths, or to certain regions, such as East Anglia or the Scottish Highlands.
Logic suggests widespread moths should be doing all right while the fussier ones are more vulnerable. The truth is more complicated. Many rare moth communities seem stable; a few of them are increasing. Yet certain once-widespread and common moths are in trouble. One is the Lappet, a big hairy moth which, when at rest, is the spitting-image of a dead leaf (its long ※snout§ makes a credible stalk). Once fairly large, the Lappet＊s population seems to have imploded. ※It＊s a complete mystery,§ says Fox. Experts are ※baffled and alarmed§. Collectors used to find its giant caterpillars, each the size of a Churchill cigar, in hedges, small bushes, and even on cultivated apple trees. ※Moths Watch only tells us where,§ says Fox, ※it doesn＊t tell us why. That will take research.§















Happier news is that some moths are doing very well. Footman moths, so-called because of the way they wrap their wings around their slim, stiff bodies like frock-coats, are romping across Britain. Thanks to the Clean Air Acts, their food plant 每 lichens on trees and stone walls 每 is thriving in towns, cities and gardens. Other moths are steadily moving north. The large, batlike Red Underwing and the Pine Hawk are advancing towards the Scottish border, presumably in response to the changing climate.













I sense from the way that Didier the postman eyes my unploughed earth each morning 每 glancing at it as furtively as if I have a piece of spaghetti stuck to my chin, and he＊s not sure if he should mention that I have already left my digging too late again.
And then someone from The Daily Telegraph phones, and says they want to take some more pictures of me on the land at La Folie. So very soon everyone, including my mum, will be able to see just how hopeless I am. In colour.
Every morning, haunted by my own inaction, I peer out of the bedroom window at the blasted plot, hoping that it will have been dug. I know this doesn＊t make any sense.









I know that the chances of elves coming and ploughing the ground in the night are about as great as the possibility of wood nymphs coming to construct the new stock-fence that I＊ve been meaning to build these last three winters.
And still I cannot help hoping for a miracle. It worked for the Tailor of Gloucester. Why shouldn＊t it work for the peasant procrastinator of La Folie?
I would phone Gilles to see if I can borrow his self-propelled plough, but my heroic ex-neighbour and I haven＊t spoken since before Christmas.
I don＊t dare ask. Besides, Gilles is always complaining about the type of friends who only ever ring him up when they want something.
So instead I just phone him for a chat. I know this is a weasel thing to do. But perhaps it will help me to summon up the courage, or shamelessness, to ask him about the plough next time.
And then, three days before the photographer is due to arrive, Gilles phones me. He and Josette will be here in an hour. They have accepted an impromptu invitation to lunch. And the plough is coming, too.
While Alice dashes out to buy baguettes and a starter 每 Gilles claims he cannot eat without bread 每 I fry lardons for spaghetti carbonara and stoke the stove until it is roaring like a Saturn V.














The carbonara is not a hit. In rural France, serving meat is a way of showing that your guests matter.
Pasta is for paupers. For a moment, from the way he strokes his silvered goatee like Blofeld with his cat, I have a nasty feeling Gilles is going to take the plough away again.
But then he says yes to a third glass of wine, and even agrees to try some cheddar. And I know that everything is going to turn out just fine.
It feels good to be working alongside my peasant mentor once again. Gilles even lets me plough some of the furrows, although not too many of them, because I＊m not very good at straight lines. And, besides, I can sense his pleasure in the work; in this brief sniff of his old life, when he was labouring with the earth, and doing something useful with his strength.











Next morning, as I look out of the window and revel in the brown ploughed loveliness of my once-and-future potager, I feel as if my whole world has changed.
Yet still my brain resists the possibility that Gilles and I could have done this.
The transformation is too magical; the result too perfect; the sensation of a weight lifted from my shoulders more like the lifting of a spell.
So either I am still asleep, and dreaming. Or else it must have been goblins, after all.
















Looking at all the breeds together in Adam＊s flock 每 a flurry of 25 kinds of bird including geese and water fowl 每 makes you feel a bit like a child in a sweet shop.
To help make deciding easier, try to identify your priorities. If you are keen to have a regular supply of eggs throughout the year and you are not too fussed about appearances, you are probably best off with a hybrid. These have been bred since the Sixties, are docile, stress-free and knock out about 300 eggs in their first year.
Another factor to consider is broodiness: hybrids do not get broody and you are unlikely to get any chicks. This may or may not be a good thing for your particular needs.
Burford browns, a favourite of Adam＊s, are excellent mothers and will readily hatch clutches of eggs. These placid, beautiful birds are dark brown/black with golden flecks. They lay brown eggs (about 200 per year) and are far more glamorous than a hybrid variety.
Other beauties worth considering are Sussex (old grey/white speckled variety), Orpingtons and Scots dumpy (rare, black and various colours, short-legged). They are all fabulous looking and have bags of personality.
If you are thinking of cutting down on time spent mowing 每 geese are very useful grazers; four will mow the equivalent of one sheep. They are excellent guard dogs, too.











Sheep
The general consensus is that sheep are a little bit more complex to work with than pigs. You need a larger, fenced area to start with and most breeds need regular shearing, worming, feet trimming and crutching out or dagging (cutting away the dirty wool around their tails).
Timid, but hardy Soay sheep (my favourite) do not need shearing as they self-shed and little dagging is necessary as they have short tails. Worming may not always be necessary. Adam takes samples to his vet and only treats when worms are present.
If you have heavy land, Adam recommends the lighter-footed animals such as Soay, Castlemilk moorit (rare and decorative) and Shetland (small, thrifty and easy lambers), because they poach the ground less.
Pigs












Adam is very fond of his Tamworths, rich golden ginger beauties with extra-long snouts. It is an ideal breed for outdoors and good for reclaiming wild scrubby areas! Pigs do dig (unless you ring their noses) though in woodland the dug-over land is less visible. They enjoy the habitat, too. Both Tamworths and Gloucestershire old spots are placid varieties, but once they grow to their full, huge size they are not so easy to handle. To keep them tame and friendly it is worth keeping in regular contact with them and supplying regular treats. Kune kune pigs are popular as pets, but Adam eats his, too.










Cows
If you supplement your grass with hay or soilage you can probably have one cow per acre (although you really need two for company). Belted Galloways, Adam＊s favourite, are remarkable 每 black, red or dun with a broad white belt, and they are a healthy breed as unusually their tasty meat has the same fat content as chicken or fish. They are good-natured, have no horns, are long lived and calf easily.
In many ways, if you have the space, cows are less demanding than pigs or sheep. They don＊t graze the grass as finely 每 sheep definitely give a more lawn-like sward 每 but they are sociable beasts to have around. The slaughtering aspect is the only downside. Recently we have started home slaughtering, employing a professional. There is no transport involved and it seems a much kinder method. Bear in mind that you can only consume the meat yourself, you cannot sell it.
All in all, keeping livestock is a responsibility, but it reaps huge rewards, and by keeping a few rare varieties you are helping keep traditional British breeds alive, too.

















Pre-heat the oven to 180C/350F/Gas 4.
Place rhubarb in a pan with 1 tbsp of the caster sugar and 1 tbsp of water. Cook gently over a low heat for 5-6 minutes or until the fruit is just tender.
Drain the rhubarb through a sieve, discarding the juice, and set aside to cool.
Grease and baseline a small baking tin.
To make topping, place butter and flour in a food processor and blitz until combined.
Add the demerara sugar and pulse a couple of times to give a rough crumble. Remove and set aside.












To make the cake mixture, blend together the butter, remaining sugar, self-raising flour, cinnamon and eggs in the processor for 30 seconds.
Remove the blade from the bowl and stir in the cooled rhubarb.
Spoon the mixture into the prepared tin and sprinkle over the topping, pressing down lightly with the back of a spoon.
Bake for 50-55 minutes or until the sponge has risen and the topping is golden.
Remove from the oven, leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
For the outdoors: Cut into 28 squares and place in an airtight container. Alternatively, place the cake back in the tin, wrap the whole tin in foil and cut the squares straight from the tin.














'We design our products to look timeless so they are not susceptible to trends,' says Jorrit Jorritsma, who co-founded the company with his wife, Nicky Forbes, in 2008, 'and at every step in the chain we make sure we're making the best environmental choices.'
The rapid growth of the business (turnover last year was ㏒165,000 and is expected to be ㏒300,000 this year) has meant Jorritsma works the same hours as he did when he was the managing director of the accessories brand Kangol, in Nottingham. But since moving to the Lake District he now spends his days in a shed at the bottom of the garden with Forbes, testing out the kit on twice-daily walks and seeing more of his daughter, Kiah, 12.










In spring Millican will be adding a new colour range to its current 17 products, which are stocked by 27 retailers, including Selfridges in London, and will be rolling out another six products this summer.
'The friends with bags named after them compete over which bag sells the best,' Jorritsma laughs. 'It is currently Mark, the field bag, which the real Mark [pictured outside his shop in Keswick] is not shy about telling everyone' 










Jennifer Egan＊s new novel, her fourth, is playful in a serious way, complex in a straightforward way, more culturally penetrating than a shelf of Don DeLillos and contains some of the fizziest prose of the year. It＊s a surprise that its author isn＊t better known in Britain, although that may be about to change: A Visit from the Goon Squad, which was published in America last year, won the National Book Critics＊ Circle Award for fiction earlier this month and has arrived on these shores just in time to take up position on the Orange Prize long list.












Somewhere between a short story collection and a novel, A Visit from the Goon Squad is told in discontinuous chapters that skip back and forth through time, from the Seventies to the present and beyond to a startling, science-fictional American future. One chapter＊s bit-part player becomes the protagonist of the next, and characters mentioned in passing in one account are pushed into the limelight for subsequent instalments. So from a first chapter introducing Sasha, glamorous kleptomaniac secretary to the rock-music magnate Benny Salazar, we graduate to the inmost thoughts of Benny himself, spraying pesticide in his armpits, guzzling gold leaf and racked with desperate lust; then on, via an excerpt from Benny＊s punk adolescence, to the life of his dissipated mentor Lou, then Lou＊s children. And so on down, sideways and back up through time.










No two of these vignettes are quite the same, but each manages to cover a surprising amount of emotional ground, with Egan unearthing human verisimilitude in the least likely settings. It＊s one of several traits that her writing shares with that of the late David Foster Wallace: others include a profound interest in the metaphorical implications of technology, a startling degree of insight into obsessional and addictive behaviours, a juicy delight in precision vocabulary and a predisposition to near-farcical satire. None of that, though, stops Egan from offering a delicious send-up of the self-inspecting, endlessly footnoted Wallace style in one chapter, as a mentally unstable journalist bedevilled by his own interior monologue attempts hopelessly to interview a Hollywood starlet.











But Egan isn＊t short of invention of her own. She writes excellently about the sensations of hearing and playing music, often the crucial aspect missing from rock＊n＊roll novels (one character memorably notes ※people and instruments and beaten-looking equipment aligning abruptly into a single structure of sound, flexible and alive§), and she has an important knack of freshening the most elementary sensations with new language. Her novel also makes several bracing leaps into the weird: while most of it takes place in real-world locations (New York, San Francisco, Naples, Mombasa) between the Seventies and the present, the final chapter imagines a future in thrall to online communication, where people have got ※tired of talking§, pre-verbal toddlers equipped with handsets have become the record industry＊s main clients, and adults buzz each other baffled txtspk questions like ※if thr r childrn, thr mst b a fUtr, rt?§ An earlier passage takes place in the water-starved, solar-powered suburbs of a near-future America, and is told entirely in PowerPoint diagrams: but what in lesser authors would be a mere gimmick here attains a strange gravity of its own, thanks to the quiet perceptiveness that beams even through Egan＊s most antic prose.














A Visit from the Goon Squad is a work of imaginative energy and charm, and it deserves to win Egan many converts this side of the Atlantic. So much the better if those converts went on to explore some of the back catalogue, which takes in five books of great talent and surprising range.
Given the vigorous experimentation in the later work, the apparent traditionalism of Egan＊s first two books is striking. She followed a hit-and-miss collection of short stories, Emerald City (1993), with the novel The Invisible Circus (1995), a coming-of-age story set at the tail-end of the Seventies that follows a young American girl who heads to Europe to investigate her sister＊s death. But the Germany and Italy she dreams of are still in the grip of the Baader-Meinhof attacks and the Italian anni di piombo, and a quest that begins simply will end with some disturbing revelations. The Invisible Circus ends up delivering a disproportionate emotional charge, and Egan＊s precise, calm, underwater prose is a persistent pleasure even as her protagonist slips further into trouble.
















Egan＊s next book, Look at Me, took five years to write, and marked a turning point in style and content. Borrowing from generic stylings 〞 among them information-age satire, conspiracy thriller, teenage bildungsroman and Lynchian identity-drama 〞 it worryingly anticipates many of the public and private social changes we now take for granted.
The premise is unsettling enough: a model has reconstructive surgery after a car crash and returns to New York unrecognisable to everyone she knows. But around that central axis Egan has built a potent and deeply peculiar fable of identity, technological mission creep, terrorism and the atrophy of personal relations in a virtual age.
Look at Me may well end up being remembered for sniffing the air early on home-grown terrorism 〞 a central character is an Islamist sleeper plotting vengeance against the American way of life, musing that he could probably do better than the World Trade Centre attacks in 1993. (The book appeared in mid-September 2001.)
What really stands out is that, a year before even the first serious social networking website Friendster came online, Egan had already nailed the progressive shifts in usage and behaviour that the technology would bring about. The mealy mouthed IT entrepreneurs in Look at Me dream of creating a site called Ordinary People, in which people create microsites called ※Personal Spaces§ to bring their experiences to the attention of screenwriters and researchers. ※I＊m not especially interested in Joe Shmoe＊s take on life,§ explains the boss, ※but if Joe Shmoe is an Ordinary Person, that means we＊ve decided his story's worthwhile.§ Slowly, his listener ※begins to grasp not just his words, but the strange new world they described. Strange, yet familiar, too.§















All this, of course, seems rather less remote 10 years down the line. Sure enough, Egan returns to satirise the topic in A Visit from the Goon Squad, introducing a character to her imagined future America whose studies focus on language that ※no longer has meaning outside quotation marks§:
English was full of these empty words 〞 ※friend§ and ※real§ and ※story§ and ※change§ 〞 words that had been shucked of their meanings and reduced to husks. Some, like ※identity§, ※search§ and ※cloud§, had clearly been drained of meaning by their Web usage. With others, the reasons were more complex: how had ※American§ become an ironic term? How had ※democracy§ come to be used in an arch, mocking way?
The Keep (2006), a blend of Gothic novel and deconstructionist fantasy that skips between a haunted castle in eastern Europe and a creative-writing class in an American prison, made rather less profitable use of Egan＊s fearlessly inventive talents. Fluid and satisfying on a sentence-to-sentence level, it was still a more sterile affair than its predecessors 〞 a relatively common failing in novels whose plots are about the nature of plot itself, as dedicated followers of Paul Auster may have found out.

















Both A Visit from the Goon Squad and Look at Me, though, pull off the elusive trick of being extremely funny and relentlessly about something at the same time. Ten years after its publication, Look at Me now appears almost indecently contemporary: a zeitgeist novel that has hardly aged seems something of a contradiction in terms. A Visit from the Goon Squad, which mixes the old-fashioned satisfactions of great dialogue and well-written character with a distinctly uncommon message of faith in the future, could well enjoy a similarly long life.














Several chapters pass before we understand the thinking behind its cryptic title, which eventually comes in an observation by one protagonist that ※Time＊s a goon. You gonna let that goon push you around?§ But readers will by then have worked out that this is a book whose plot takes place in the cracks of time and memory, constructed in the gaps between chapters and in the distance between separate views of an event: and that its many breaks, false exits and attempted conclusions come to embody an obstinate, backhanded faith in continuance and renewal.
A Visit from the Goon Squad ends up being a sort of anti-jeremiad, a book written against the fashionable truisms of contemporary pessimism: the death of good music, the death of the printed word, the death of the environment and the omnipresent supposition that, as one character puts it, ※we＊re finished, all of us ＃ the whole country, the f-----g world§. The fractured, asynchronous flow of Egan＊s novel is a quiet demonstration that the goon squad may push everyone around, but not all at the same time. Or as another character says, consolingly, ※Sure, everything is ending. But not yet.§












Like many emotions, boredom is far easier to experience than to write about. As the parent of any teenager knows, the word itself quickly exhausts synonyms, as if even language collapses when confronted by feelings of flatness and dullness: ※I＊m bored. Bored, bored, bored§.

Perhaps that is why the best explanations tend to come from those who are curious about the world, not from those who find themselves twiddling their thumbs and staring glassily into space. Nobody could write a line like the one Chekhov gives to Yeliena in Uncle Vanya 每 ※I＊m dying of boredom＃ I don＊t know what to do§ 每 unless he was still intrigued by life＊s possibilities. Only someone who knew exactly what he was doing could take such a boring situation and make it so entertaining.









Few writers on boredom can match Peter Toohey when it comes to finding pleasure, excitement and even a perverse kind of glee in his subject. He appears to be incapable of writing a dull page. Even his list of the words associated with boredom has a sprawling energy to it: ※blah, bland, never ending, mind numbing, monochrome＃ Flat as a tack. Dull as ditchwater. Ho hum.§
If none of these terms seems exactly synonymous with ※boring§, Toohey would probably claim that this is inevitable. While we tend to think of boredom as a single emotion, he argues, in fact it is an umbrella term that covers many different kinds of response, from disgust to melancholia. Boredom, Toohey suggests, is used to refer to a particular kind of experience that emerged alongside new opportunities for leisure in the 18th century, as one of the enlightenment＊s many dark doubles, and also characterises feelings of tedium or inertia that are experienced at all times and in all places.













The evidence Toohey assembles in support of this idea is dazzling in its variety 每 everything from a piece of Pompeii graffiti ironically lamenting the number of bored citizens who scribble on its walls, to research indicating that playing classical music perks up elephants held in captivity. ※Swaying, pacing and trunk tossing,§ he gravely explains, ※are all minimised when the tuskers listen to Mozart.§
Sadly, in terms of his argument, this variety too often comes at the price of coherence. Full of odds and ends, but forever darting in new directions as it shifts between psychology, art history and a dozen other frames of reference, Toohey＊s prose is like a curious hybrid of magpie and hummingbird.
As his subtitle suggests, it is as if he wanted to resist the accusation of adding to the sum of human boredom, or perhaps he simply did not trust his readers with anything more complicated. Full of idiosyncratic digressions and jerky jump cuts, this is cultural history for the internet generation.
In fact, Toohey has such a generous interpretation of boredom 每 encompassing everything from existentialist philosophy to ADHD 每 his writing seems incapable of noticing an artwork or piece of research without trying to swallow it up. It is a bore constrictor of a book.














Victoria Beckham came top of the Independent＊s ※Boring List§ in 2008, he claims, because ※she always seems to be photographed with the same rather blank expression§. The lion in Magritte＊s painting Le Mal du Pays is ※dare I say bored-looking§. Even his ※telltale signs that give boredom away§ seem arbitrary. Apparently these include yawning, staring off into the distance and placing one＊s hands on one＊s hips, although Toohey is reticent about how reliable they might be in distinguishing the bored from the tired or thoughtful. Nor does he explain how he might convince, say, Jack Kerouac or Vita Sackville-West that road trips and gardening are among the most ※fertile sources of boredom§.
Yet while this is at best a scattershot survey, one that at times seems likely to disintegrate into a catalogue, it is also potentially significant in suggesting that boredom is not just diverse in the ways it is experienced. It can also be combated in equally diverse ways.














Some of his suggestions, such as exercise and mental stimulation, are, he admits, ※thumpingly obvious§, though still helpful for anyone wondering what to do with a toddler on a wet bank holiday. Others are probably not to be recommended, such as the case of the 30-year-old chimp in a Swedish zoo who patiently collects rocks every day before opening time, which he then spends a few merry hours lobbing at the visitors.
Still, the example of this book suggests that there may be a more peaceful alternative to boredom: reading. Though often quirky or questionable, Toohey＊s writing certainly isn＊t boring.

Boredom: a Lively History











We all think we know the fundamentals of the Cold War. It started in 1945, when allies became rivals, and two ruthless superpowers maintained it until a sudden generational shift in the Kremlin gave way to popular pressures in what used to be called the Soviet Empire.

However, as Jonathan Haslam＊s meticulous and densely informative book shows, nothing was quite what it seemed. The paranoia of Stalin and the instabilities that caused in his regime have been well documented; but, among much else disclosed by Haslam＊s trawling through Soviet archives, are the misgovernment, nervousness, fear and continued instability during the eras of Khruschev and Brezhnev.
Indeed, until Gorbachev took over and confronted reality, it seems that the Soviet Union never really had anything approaching intelligent, sound government.
For Haslam, the Cold War starts with the Russian Revolution in 1917, and the next 24 years until Hitler＊s invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 are crucial for establishing the foundations of difficult, mistrustful relationships between countries with an ideology of democracy and a power bloc founded on Marxism. This compelled Stalin to drive a ruthlessly hard bargain from 1943 to 1945 in seeking to shape the post-war world.













Haslam reminds us that there were other, often more dangerous and infinitely bloodier, fields of conflict outside Europe. Vietnam and the Cuban Missile crisis are the best known: but the Soviet Union intervened, with varying degrees of success, in Africa, South America, the Middle East and other parts of the Far East. The Cold War was a world war in which the threat and fear of nuclear holocaust was perpetually present.
Haslam＊s archival work has allowed him to describe in detail the relationships between the main Politburo players and how this created the internal dynamic of the superpower.













He is also adept at concise pen portraits of these often ghastly men (and they were inevitably men). Molotov was ※more moderate§ than Stalin, ※though extremely tough, highly efficient, slow, plodding, dull, unrelenting, always in control§. Malenkov, Communist Party secretary at the time of Stalin＊s death, was ※short＃ eunuch-like, plump, flabby, with a full head of dark hair, a cherubic but sallow complexion§. The revolting Beria, Stalin＊s secret police chief, was ※rather a stout man, with a fleshy face and blue ice-cold staring eyes§. One can almost smell the monsters.
The Khruschev years are remembered now for his repudiation of Stalin, in a secret speech to the 20th party congress of 1956 whose gradual dissemination to the West is described by Haslam, starting with an account sent to Paris by the French ambassador. Yet, as the author also shows us, it was an era of diplomatic disasters and misjudgments in China, Western Europe and, most notably, America. It is clear that Khruschev＊s own demise was initiated by his miscalculation during the Cuban missile crisis.













The Brezhnev years ushered in a gerontocracy, exemplified by the deaths of Brezhnev＊s two elderly successors within three years of his own. Stricken with fear of the United States and Nato, the Politburo placed a renewed emphasis on repression, in Czechoslovakia in 1968 and Poland in 1981.
The defence of socialism became paramount: even as he went gaga, Brezhnev understood that the slightest hint of tolerating dissent would have the whole house of cards crashing down. By the end he was incapable of understanding the script his flunkeys gave him to read out.











Brezhnev＊s instincts were right. The minute Gorbachev realised that the tide of freedom could no longer be held back, the whole Soviet empire came tumbling down, and Russia was, once more, just Russia.
Haslam＊s superb research puts his book in a league of its own, and it is hard to imagine it being surpassed as an account of what went on inside Russian foreign policy in this period.








David E Hoffman＊s The Dead Hand is a more journalistic, breathless account of the closing chapter of the Cold War, as played out between Reagan and Gorbachev: but it also deals with the legacy of the nuclear and biological weapons left behind, and details the anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) in 1979.
It deals with the American side of the equation as well, and concentrates on the relationship between the two leaders. Hoffman＊s research has been reasonably thorough, especially in American archives, but his tone is depressingly novelistic. If you like your history told James Bond style, you＊ll love his book.










David Bezmozgis projects a sense of ease that is very rare in first novels; he does everything well, though economy in characterisation is his strongest gift.

The Free World is concerned with a journey from Riga, in Latvia, to Canada, though we never reach the destination and we see the departure-point only in flashback. Indeed, most of the book is set in the past: the novel＊s present-day episodes take place in Rome, where the Krasnansky family pass the summer, waiting to be approved for emigration to the United States.
This is not a tale of an 谷migr谷＊s effort to assimilate or of a struggle for survival, but the syndrome of the would-be 谷migr谷, for whom everything treasured and familiar is a thing of the past but who hasn＊t a clue what the future holds in store. It is a more precarious situation but a more hopeful one too.













Bezmozgis, when very young, undertook the journey from Latvia to Canada at around the time that the Krasnanskys take theirs (1978), but he has decided not to adopt a child＊s-eye view. The older Krasnansky son, Karl, has two young boys with his wife, Rosa, but the book＊s perspective is entrusted to Karl＊s younger brother, the 26-year-old Alec, their father, Samuil, and Alec＊s wife, Polina.
The result is that Karl and Alec＊s mother, Emma, is never portrayed in her own right (or given flashbacks), though she nevertheless features a great deal because she spends so much time in the company of characters with whom the novel is more directly concerned.
Alec takes to this interim existence, finding himself a job and a mistress, but Polina feels stifled by freedom and alienated by novelty. Without nudging the reader or constricting his characters, Bezmozgis generates numerous details about the relationship between familiarity and acquaintance on the one hand, exoticism and strangeness on the other.














While the indignities suffered in the past at least conformed to ※some perverted Soviet logic§, Polina finds the choreography of Roman traffic ※inscrutable§. To her, Vienna, Leningrad, Riga and Moscow were all ※Europe§, but Rome, with its ※withering summer heat, filth and disorder§, is ※Africa§.
The book＊s dominant mode is a kind of wry comedy, based on the sensibility of characters we get to know well rather than comic scenarios or pratfalls.
After the Krasnanskys are advised by the Hebrew Immigration Aid Society that Canada is a better bet than the US, on the grounds it is safer, cleaner and closer to Latvia in climate, Karl tries to persuade Rosa by offering a further argument: ※You watched the Olympics. You liked what you saw of Montreal.§
There is an obvious disjuncture here between the gravity of the decision and the frivolity of this argument 每 and it is obvious not just to the reader but to Rosa as well. Karl decides to step up his argument: ※It＊s more American than Europe and more European than America.§












When Rosa continues to express incredulity, Alec clarifies: ※A person can eat and dress like a human being, watch hockey and accomplish all this without victimising negroes and Latin American peasants.§
If Bezmozgis slips up at all, it is in his portrayal of Samuil, a committed atheist and lifelong Communist Party devotee whose sense of disappointment becomes increasingly stereotypical as the novel progresses.
At one point, Alec considers the ※austerity§ of his father＊s solitude, but the character who best embodies the pathos of the would-be 谷migr谷 is the good-natured Lyova, the Kiev-born tour guide from whom Alec and Polina are renting a room. It is Lyova who gives the book its title, having not yet abandoned ※the idea that I＊m a free man in a free world§; he refuses to surrender to pessimism, despite all his bad luck.












As a tank officer in the army, Lyova was sent to Prague, where he was assigned to point a submachine gun at students: ※Pretty girls in raincoats spat at me.§ And when he left the Soviet Union for Israel, he found no greater happiness there. Towards the end of the novel, he expresses a new, modest ambition for his life: ※So far I＊ve been a citizen of two utopias＃ I want to live in the country with the fewest parades.§










When I was nine, I was captivated by a book about a boy who discovers he has magical powers and is sent away to learn witchcraft at a mysterious castle. This was a good 20 years before Harry Potter, and the author was Diana Wynne Jones 每 who later said mildly of J.K Rowling: ※I think that she read my books as a young person＃ There are so many striking similarities.§ I thought so, too. But Rowling, however gifted a storyteller, did not have her style, wit and lightness of touch. I still laugh, and shiver, whenever I read Charmed Life, the first in Wynne Jones＊s Chrestomanci series.









Her obituary in this paper today shows the extent of her extraordinary imagination 每 but her childhood was even more remarkable. My older brother emailed me an essay she wrote about it, which he found on her website: ※I fear we will never be successful authors,§ he wrote, ※because our parents were too kind to us and lacked the foresight to keep us in a shed.§
Wynne Jones＊s parents were astoundingly neglectful. In 1943, they accepted a job in the Essex village of Thaxted, running a conference centre promoting cultural events for young adults. While they lived in the splendid Queen Anne house, their three young daughters were housed in a lean-to shack, with rising damp. Diana and her sister Ursula both contracted juvenile rheumatism. There was nowhere to wash, ※so we seldom bothered. Nor did we wash our hair.§










Although their father was an educationalist, he starved his daughters of books. The girls＊ mother resented using clothing coupons for their school uniforms, so they were sometimes clad in garments that had been rejected by the matron of a local orphanage as unsuitable. She also used to say, of any illness, ※it＊s only psychological§. As a result, the young Diana went to school with chicken pox, scarlet fever, German measles and appendicitis 每 ※for six months§.
Eventually, the local doctor, who had only three fingers on his right hand, removed the diseased organ. Diana kept it in a bottle, so she could show her mother the boils on it, and prove she hadn＊t been lying. Her mother retorted that giving sympathy ※damages me§, which was possibly why she repeatedly called her oldest daughter ugly and ※semi-delinquent§. When the girls＊ parents ※took their yearly holiday, we were left with the gardener, the minister of the chapel, or the matron of the orphanage 每 or simply dumped on Granny.§








The Queen＊s head chef, Mark Flanagan, has given a few clues to the ※all-British§ canap谷s he＊s concocting for Prince William and Kate Middleton. I can＊t help wondering, however, if it＊s a good idea to serve canap谷s at all. In my experience, wedding guests are starving after a long service, lusty singing, and time spent dragging their feet while the photographer poses the bride. When only finger food is served, attention becomes desperately focused on the fast-disappearing backs of waiters bearing away blinis. Few disappointments compare to the sorrow of being offered a little stick with celery and cheese, when at the other side of the room some blighter has secured the last king prawn.










Anthony Browne＊s children＊s books don＊t start with a story, character or image. They start with a shape and a game. So at this year＊s Hay Festival, the setting of one of the writer and illustrator＊s last public outings as Children＊s Laureate, it seems only fitting that Browne will be showing his audience how to play it.
The rules are simple: The first person draws any shape they want and then the second person looks at it and transforms it into something recognisable. Whereas writers jot down ideas on napkins, Browne has always used quick, random sketches as a sort of visual shorthand and he relishes the prospect of playing a huge interactive version with his audience. ※Everything good in my career started with a singular shape and I think the same goes for a lot of illustrators.§











Discussing how other artists, including Picasso, have been playing their own versions of the game for years, his appearance at Hay is just part of a two year, solid Laureate effort to restore our love of picture books: ※It＊s understandable that parents want to get their children reading from an early age but you can＊t appreciate the structure of a sentence when you＊re seven. We all need reminding that creativity is born out of pictures.§
As inspiration, the artist will be showing one of his earliest attempts at the game: ※I was about six and I＊d drawn a pair of legs in shorts. They were mine, I think.§ So far, so normal except poking out of one sock is a pirate, with another one disappearing up the leg of the shorts; ※I can＊t remember why I drew it but looking at the shapes it＊s quite evident that it was one of my first goes at the game.§
※Children love a mix of utter fantasy and realism and react well to images. Yes, it＊s a literary festival but for children, Hay can be a great place to unearth the secrets of the imagination.§











Poor Anthony Browne. Just three months left as Children＊s Laureate, and everyone＊s acting as if he＊s dead. ※It＊s true§ he says. ※Having a memoir and a retrospective of your work running almost simultaneously when you＊re still alive does feel a bit posthumous.§
We＊re in Foyles＊ caf谷 on a Friday night, drinking water and listening to Prince. Browne is small with speckled hair and a warm face he keeps low to the table but still, to his disbelief, he＊s getting recognised. I explain it＊s probably wise to be seen in public, you know, to dispel the rumours. He smiles, abashed. ※I＊m not exactly famous, am I? Especially following in Michael Rosen＊s footsteps.§ He has a point. Since its incarnation in 1999, the Children＊s Laureate has read like a who＊s who in Jackanory: Quentin Blake, Anne Fine, Jacquline Wilson. After Blake, Browne is the only other ※illustrator/writer§ in that order but now, as he hands over the baton, it seems now, at 64, he＊s finally getting national recognition.















A celebratory retrospective, Through the Magic Mirror: The World of Anthony Browne, opens at the Seven Stories gallery in Newcastle on April 9. It displays his most significant work from the last 35 years realised in various, interactive mediums. These include shifting landscape from 1999＊s Voices in the Park, images from one of his most commercially successful character series, Willy the Wimp, which tackles sophisticated themes of bullying and gangs and an interactive woodland from 2005＊s Into the Forest. The comparatively less cheerful memoir, Playing the Shape Game, is already out and explains the source of the gorillas which first appeared in his breakthrough work, Gorilla in 1983 but have been a recurring theme throughout subsequent books.














※Here＊s your scoop 每 they＊re all my father! You see, my dad was a boxer so he had this fierce, physical presence. Of all the animals gorillas seemed to work best. They＊re also fun to draw.§
Browne＊s father fought in World War Two before leaving the army to run a pub above which they all lived. It was a happy time and most evenings Browne, as a child, would take to the bar and regale the drinkers with the adventures of Big Dumb Tackle, his superhero alter ego. One day he and his mother came home to find Browne＊s dad wrestling the hoover thinking it was a Nazi. Another time he was fixing a plug and then collapsed, shaking on the floor. It turned out that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder ※although no one knew it existed then.§ When Browne was 17, his father died in front of him.

















Speaking to the Telegraph as he nears the end of his two year role, Browne accused Gove of ※plucking a number out of thin air§ and said that asking children to meet a fixed quota would ※force them to read quickly not well which could damage their interest in books in later life.§ He added: ※The number is just too high for some children. It would have been for me at that age.§
The Education Secretary has said pupils should be reading the equivalent of a novel a week because demands placed on schoolchildren have been ※too low for too long§. But Browne suggested the figure was at odds with Gove＊s motives: ※I can see why they＊re suggesting it but to me, the point of reading is and should be for enjoyment. Making children meet arbitrary targets will make reading a difficult and painful process.§












He also said he was curious as to how children would meet that target ※ given that the government is cutting the library budgets, and those of free book schemes such as Bookstart.§
Browne went on to note the lack of illustrated books on the proposed reading list, which includes works by JK Rowling and Rosemary Sutcliff. As the author of more than 40 books for children including the famous Willy the Wimp series, Browne has always maintained that images in books spark creativity in a different way to words.
※Picture books stay with you for longer and there＊s no reason why words and illustrations shouldn＊t overlap for a lot longer than they do,§ he said.














I hate the growing tendency to think that every man drops overboard his individuality between Folkestone and Boulogne,§ complained the soldier-poet Charles Hamilton Sorley in 1915.

To the press in Blighty you were either a Tommy ※with a character like a nice big fighting pet bear§ or a young officer with ※a silly habit of giggling in the face of death§. As Nicholas Murray＊s elegant biographical sketches of the war poets demonstrate, many of the poems that emerged from the conflict were pointed against the encroaching anonymity of trench warfare.
Verse could accommodate the emotion and personal experience omitted from official reports: hence Wilfred Owen＊s famous declaration that ＆＆the Poetry is in the Pity＊＊.
The haunting lyrical records of the First World War have also preserved its human perspective for later readers. They seem to cut through history, mitigating the otherwise unfathomable scale of the slaughter and, latterly, the war＊s severance from living memory.












Even so, the range of contemporary poetic attitudes to the politics of the conflict is nowadays often overlooked. The Red Sweet Wine of ?Youth provides a timely corrective: with lightly worn learning and considerable erudition, it recuperates lesser-known writers such as Julian Grenfell and T?E Hulme, and situates them alongside Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon.
Murray has a sense of how pre-war fashions in the London poetry world continued to influence both poetic style and publishing opportunities during the war. The Georgian Poetry anthologies, figure-headed by John Masefield since 1912, quickly became a forum for Sassoon and Robert Graves.
Hulme, who had founded the Imagist movement with Ezra Pound in 1909, carried the steely indifference of modernist verse to the front-line, as he observed men ※Making paths in the dark, / Through scattered dead horses, / Over a dead Belgian＊s body.§














The ※brief lives§ of Murray＊s subtitle aptly brings together the curtailed lifespans of so many of these poets, but this is no group portrait, since these writers were mostly not acquainted and felt no obligation towards each other＊s verse.
Instead, Murray presents a series of concise biographies that sometimes glance off one another but never quite intersect. This seems entirely appropriate, given that one thing these poets did share was an overwhelming sense of alienation from the world beyond the trenches.















In fact, the limited geographical circumstances of combat experience could be held against those poets who strove to speak on behalf of their fellow-soldiers: Sassoon＊s remarkable protest against ※the political errors and insincerities for which the fighting men are being sacrificed§ was criticised on such grounds.
Listen again to Owen＊s epithet ※doomed youth§ and you can begin to hear the noun straining to bridge the experience of a single individual and an entire generation.
Many of the war＊s most startling poems were written away from the front, during what Sassoon called ※time wasted in waste places§: the months of training or long periods of convalescence.
Only Owen and Isaac Rosenberg, who would scribble ※on any mud-spattered odd sheets that he could lay his hands on§, could summon the will and concentration required to shape verses in the trenches.












Nevertheless, as Murray＊s extensive quotation from letters and journals suggests, other types of writing could provide moments of respite or catharsis, from the gallows humour of Brooke, who described ※the excitement in the trenches＃ with people losing their heads and fussing and snapping§ to the grim testimony of Sassoon, whose Somme diary records corpses ※on their backs with bloody clotted fingers mingled as if they were handshaking in the companionship of death§.
Unfortunately, Murray does not cite verse with anything like the generosity he affords to prose. This makes his discussions of poetry seem rushed, which is disappointing given that this book might easily have found room for some analysis of poetic form and language to complement its historical fluency.
The Red Sweet Wine of Youth is a fine account of the poetic sensibility of the period, which makes a sprightly case for several poets who run the risk of being forgotten. But it might have tackled the originality of their work more directly.
