China's first law for the protection of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), including traditional oral literature, performing arts, craftsmanship, medicine and folk customs, will take effect on Wednesday.

Approved in February by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), the law has been hailed by experts as a milestone for China's efforts to better preserve its traditions of historic, literary, artistic and scientific value.

According to the law, the State Council and provincial governments must create lists of representative intangible cultural heritage for national and local levels, respectively.

Governments at all levels will assist with intangible cultural heritage preservation efforts in ethnic minority areas, remote areas and poverty-stricken areas.

Aside from providing effective protection, the law also encourages the development of cultural products and services based on rational use of the representative ICH items.

The law also supports representative heirs in carrying forward intangible cultural heritage items and conducting follow-up personnel training.

Cultural authorities must provide necessary places and funds for representative heirs to pass on related skills and knowledge and encourage participation in non-profit social activities, according to the law.

The law also states that foreign organizations and individuals, before conducting surveys of ICH, will be required to first obtain approval from cultural authorities that are at least on the provincial level.

Also, foreign organizations and individuals must submit their research reports along with copies of on-site data and pictures during the survey.

Statistics show that China has 1,028 state-level ICH items and 1,488 state-level representative heirs. The country's total ICH resources amount to nearly 870,000 items.









A painting by contemporary Chinese artist Qi Baishi was sold by Beijing-based China Guardian on Sunday for 425.5 million yuan (65 million U.S. dollars), a record high for contemporary and modern Chinese paintings and calligraphy.

The high auction price was, in the history of the Chinese mainland art market, second only to ancient calligrapher Huang Tingjian's hand scroll "Pillar Ming," which was sold for 436.8 million yuan in 2009.

The work of Qi, entitled "Eagle Standing on Pine Tree with Four-character Couplet in Seal Script," consists of a painting measuring 266 cm by 100 cm and a pair of calligraphy scrolls each measuring 264.5 cm by 65.8 cm. It is said to be Qi's largest work.

Qi was born in 1864 in central China's Hunan Province and died at the age of 93. Although he relished the portrayal of small things, such as birds, fish, fruit and vegetables, Qi was also known as an outstanding calligrapher.

The auctioned work, according to the signature on the scroll, was finished in 1946 when the painter was 86 years old.

"Qi Baishi is the most influential artist in China's contemporary and modern art history. This work, with its high price, marks a new era for the market of contemporary and modern Chinese artworks," said Guo Tong, general manger of the contemporary and modern Chinese painting and calligraphy department under China Guardian.

Figures from the art market data organization Art Price show that Qi's works raked in more than 70 million U.S. dollars in sales worldwide in 2009, only behind the works of Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol.

Also on Friday, a guqin, or a plucked seven-string Chinese musical instrument of the zither family, fetched 115 million yuan at a separate auction also hosted by China Guardian.

The sold item dates back to the Tang Dynasty and is believed to be some 1,250 years old.

The high-profile sales came amid the exponential growth of the Chinese fine art market in recent years. According to a report released earlier this year by artprice.com, China soared from the ninth place to first in 2010, becoming the world's largest auction marketplace for fine art, overtaking the United States and Britain.

The spring auction at China Guardian runs from May 21 to 25 and includes categories such as Chinese painting and calligraphy, porcelain, jewels, stamps and coins, Chinese oil paintings and sculptures, rare books and manuscripts.










The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) rose from second last year to the top university in Asia in 2011, according to the Quacquarelli Symonds (QS) Asian University Rankings released on Monday.

It's the first time for HKUST to top the ranking as it celebrates its 20th anniversary this year.

Among top five universities in Asia, three were from Hong Kong, with University of Hong Kong being second, the Chinese University of Hong Kong rating fifth.

An announcement from QS, an international information specialist in the higher education sector, stated that "the dynamism of the (Asian) region is confirmed by the fact that 20 percent of the top 50 universities are less than 50 years old."

Ben Sowter, head of QS Intelligence Unit, said that HKUST was strong across most of the indicators, with its international character setting it apart.

HKUST President Tony Chan said, to ensure continued success, they will put in greater effort in recruiting excellent faculty and students and encourage entrepreneurship. HKUST will leverage on China's rapid economic growth and investment in science and technology, he said.

Published for the first time in 2009, the QS Asian University Rankings is published annually and ranks Asia's top 200 universities based on relevant criteria including academic peer review, recruiter review, student/faculty ratio and so on.












 For decades, attending universities has been the Chinese version of the "American Dream", promising a rise from rags to riches for those who have studied hard and invested heavily in education.

A recent slump, however, in the number of students enrolling to take the college entrance examinations has awakened Chinese universities to an inconvenient truth: the era of glory has gone and they will soon have to contend for the decreasing number of students.

This year, central China's Henan Province reported a decrease of 97,000 applicants for the national college entrance exam (NCEE). It is the largest year-on-year drop for the province after the number of applicants took a downward spiral in 2008.

The province, however, after registering 855,000 applicants for the exam in June, still ranks the first in China.

More alarming is that the trend is becoming national. According to a report on eol.cn, a major portal reporting on education in China, this year's NCEE registration has dropped 10 percent in Anhui, 6 percent in Beijing, and 12 percent in Shanghai.

The overall number of candidates seeking to take the NCEE in China, it said, shrank 1 million in 2009 and 2010 after the culmination of candidates in 2008.

GOING-OUT STUDENTS

A number of factors, including a declining birth rate, difficulties in obtaining quality education, and easier access to overseas universities, have combined to drain the student pool of Chinese universities.

"This year's huge drop followed the exodus of second-time applicants who are disappointed by the fierce competition," said Chen Daqi, an official at the provincial office for college enrollment.

This extraordinary competition in the NCEE used to compel many Chinese students to study extra years before they receive high enough scores and satisfactory offers. In Henan, about one-third of those taking the NCEE are not first-time applicants.

Apart from the disenchanted veterans this year, many are also leaving the NCEE army as they question the quality of Chinese higher education.

"For sure, China has more universities and modern campuses, but few are encouraging innovation and cultivating talents," said a Luoyang citizen surnamed Qi.

Like many wealthy families, Qi is applying for an American university for his 18-year-old son through the city's burgeoning education agencies.

Yang Fei, manager of a Zhengzhou-based education agency, said his business has taken a cheerful upturn since 2008, as the appreciation of the Renminbi and the depreciation of Chinese universities make studying abroad a favored option for high school students.

"In the past, only those with poor academic performances came to us as they couldn't get admitted to domestic universities, but now top students have become our major customers," said Yang.

However, Yang also feels the pressure, as many senior high schools are setting up their own institutions to provide consulting services and training programs.h According to the Education Department of Henan, more than 40 high schools in the province are awaiting approval for their international cooperation programs, while over 20 have opened classes to prepare their students for studies abroad.












Xia Tao, who works for a private university in Shandong, said the shrinking student pool has threatened the operation of the school, which largely relies on tuition fees from recruited students.

Shandong ranks the second among Chinese provinces in terms of NCEE takers, but this year marks the third consecutive year for the figure to fall.

"Recruitment was already very hard, as private universities lack the public recognition of the public counterparts. Now it's like rubbing salt into the wound," said Xia.

Educational experts said that the reduced supply of students has brought a financial crisis to Chinese universities and colleges. Many private schools, due to their low rank and enrollment rate, are nearly forced into insolvency.

Deng Xiangchao, vice dean of the School of Art of Shandong Jianzhu University, said the low enrollment rate would also hit public universities that look to more students to pay the huge debts incurred by their expansion fever.

"The crisis is not necessarily a bad thing. It shows the public discontent of the declining quality of higher education and will whip universities into reforms," said Deng.

Chinese universities have been obsessed in building larger campuses since 1999, when the central government called for the popularization of higher education, and now it is time to catch up in quality, said Deng.











Chinese opera performer Zhang Jun has been selected as the UNESCO Artist for Peace for a period of two years for his "long-term commitment to promoting" Chinese Kunqu Opera, the Paris-based UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization announced Monday.

UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova will designate Zhang during an official ceremony at UNESCO Headquarters in Paris on May 26, the organization said in a statement.

Born in Shanghai, in 1974, Zhang is a leading promoter of Kunqu, one of the oldest forms of Chinese opera, inscribed in 2008 on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.

While pursuing his stage career, Zhang Jun has promoted programs such as the Hope Project to build schools and improve education in China's poorest areas. He has also supported numerous cultural initiatives in Shanghai.

After receiving the laureate, Zhang Jun will help raise national and international awareness of the importance of intangible cultural heritage and its safeguarding, including Kunqu Opera, the statement added.

Kunqu was developed under the Ming dynasty (14th-17th centuries) in the city of Kunshan in east China and is characterized by the combination of song, recital and complex choreographic techniques, which include acrobatic and symbolic gestures. This genre, having inspired a revival of Chinese theatre in the Ming era, risked disappearance from the stage in the 20th century.

The Artist for Peace is appointed by UNESCO every two years to drive public awareness regarding key development issues. Chinese actress Kong Li won the honor in 2000 and the China Disabled People's Performing Art Troupe in 2006.









World renowned Chinese scholar Jao Tsung-i received an honorary Doctor of Letters from the University of Tasmania of Australia in a ceremony held in Hong Kong on Monday.

Known as one of China's most outstanding scholars, Jao is expert in many fields in the arts and has helped establish China's rightful place in the global cultural pantheon by bringing to the attention of the world at large the richness of Chinese literature, history and art.

He is also renowned in his own right as an artist, calligrapher and poet, and has been the inspiration for the establishment of a new style of Chinese art, the North West School, informed by the famous Dunhuang Buddhist frescoes.

Jao has taught at the University of Hong Kong, the National University of Singapore and Yale University, and has lectured in France, Japan, China's mainland, Taiwan and Macao.

Now 95 years old, Jao has an impressive record of achievement to his name; along with publishing more than 80 books and 500 papers, he is currently Wei Lun Honorary Professor of Fine Arts and Emeritus Professor of Chinese Language and Literature at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

University of Tasmania Vice-Chancellor Peter Rathjen described Jao as a "renaissance man" and said he was regarded as "a living treasure" in China. "Through his work as an artist, poet, calligrapher and scholar Professor Jao has given China two great gifts," Rathjen said.

"He has given the Chinese people a sense of who they are and confidence in the worth of the rich and diverse tapestry that is their history and culture, helping shape China's sense of nationhood in the twentieth century," Rathjen said.

"He has also given those of other cultures a deep and abiding appreciation of China's place in the world and contribution to our global heritage."

Jao's work would continue to have a strong and abiding impact throughout the world for many years to come, Rathjen added.















A museum in northwest China's Shaanxi Province plans to exhibit retrieved treasures that were stolen from the tomb of a Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907) queen and sold abroad.

Shaanxi History Museum will display the retrieved relics later this year, which include a stone coffin and five well-preserved murals.

"After the murals are repaired, we'll hold a public exhibition to showcase the ancient treasures and to celebrate their retrieval," said Cheng Xu, deputy head of the museum, who was involved in getting back the stolen pieces over the past six years.

The coffin and murals were taken from the tomb of Wu Huifei (699-737), a concubine of Xuanzong, the seventh emperor of the Tang Dynasty, and sold in the United States.

Police in Xi'an apprehended a gang of thieves, headed by Yang Bin, in 2006 as the gang was attempting to rob another Tang Dynasty tomb in the suburbs of Xi'an.

Yang received a suspended death sentence in 2007, and two key members of his gang were sentenced to life. Other members received prison terms from 11 to 15 years.

The 27-tonne stone coffin was returned to the Shaanxi museum last year and the five murals, measuring 1.2 meters long and between 80 and 90 cm wide, were retrieved earlier this year and transferred to the museum on May 12.

Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Public Security initiated an eight-month campaign in 17 provinces to combat the rampant theft, smuggling and illegal trade of cultural relics.

The move was announced days after several works of art on loan from a Hong Kong collector were stolen from the Palace Museum in Beijing's heavily-guarded Forbidden City.










Archeologists said Wednesday they have unearthed the ruins of an ancient village that dated back at least 2,500 years at an excavation site in the southwestern Yunnan Province.

Researchers with the Yunnan Institute of Heritage and Archeology found ruins of 20 houses, ranging from 15 to 25 square meters each and built in four rows, in Chengjiang County, said Jiang Zhilong, an archeologist with the excavation team.

Inside the houses they found earthenware pieces, bronze and stone implements and animal bones, he said.

Jiang said most of the houses are believed to have been homes but a few were possibly workshops.

Jiang and his teammates also found 20 tombs near the houses, some of which had human bones inside.

The site was first discovered in 2009 and covers at least 10,000 square meters. The first phase of excavation began at the end of last year, covering 1,900 square meters. The excavation is expected to end soon.











A group of seventeen postgraduate students from China's elite Peking University will spend one year as teaching volunteers in the country's remote and underdeveloped western regions starting in August.

This will be the 13th such team that the university, famed for excellency in humanities and social sciences, has sent student volunteers to teach for one year in Tibet, Qinghai, Yunnan, Xinjiang, Ningxia, Shanxi and Henan of central and western China since 1999.

Today, the economic and social development in western China lags far behind the rest of the country. Due to poverty, quality education is difficult for many people in the western areas to receive.

Four years ago, when Sun Ke volunteered as a geography teacher at a middle school in Tibet, he was shocked to see that many of the students in his class could not afford a map costing 4.8 yuan (around 0.74 U.S. dollar).

He asked the students to each buy a map for geography studies, but it turned out only three students purchased the map.

"The kids lowered their heads, silently, when I asked them why," Sun recalled. The fact is that the poverty of the students was more severe and beyond his imagination.

"I have heard stories about poverty of kids in hilly areas on TV before, but I was really saddened when confronted with such a fact myself," he said.

Sun decided to buy the maps for the students with his own money. "When I walked into the classroom with a bundle of maps, they broke into tears, and so did I," Sun said.

During talking with Xinhua, many volunteers said the one-year of teaching provides not only an insight into how the school children cope with poverty, but also an opportunity to learn from practices and the masses.

Yang Tianhu, 25, a typical member of the 1980s generation who could not cook and seldom did laundry, is now a teaching volunteer at a middle school in Datong County of Qinghai Province.

The work, firstly, could educate one on how to take care of his daily life, such as cooking and laundry, in a rural school with poor facilities, Yang said.

Besides, he paid visits to many students' homes and talked to residents in hilly villages.

"Finally, I came to understand why people say that one can only feel the truth about our society through walking into the people' s homes at grassroots levels," Yang said.

Yang said he was deeply touched by a personal story. A girl student from a poor family was left alone to shoulder the daily burden of pig-feeding, cooking and laundry after her parents went to the cities as migrant workers.

Chinese officials have called on the country's youth, especially those who just joined the labor force after graduation from colleges, to consider exploring their careers at grassroots positions and in rural areas.

Hailing the volunteer program, Zhou Qifeng, president of Peking University, said the students have learnt a lot through working in the western regions.

In a letter dated May 10, Chinese President Hu Jintao expressed satisfaction with the work of student volunteers from Peking University after receiving a letter from the 18 volunteers who are now teaching in Tibet, Qinghai, Yunnan and Xinjiang.

"I am very satisfied with the progress you have made," Hu said, adding that the volunteer project of Peking University is an effective way to help young students learn from practice and the masses.

Hu said he hope the university could continue the practice, encouraging more young students to grow up to become the backbone of the country.

"It is a big surprise and a great honor," said Zhang Zhendong, who is among the volunteers who wrote the letter to Hu on April 9 to report their work.

"We realize the value of our work and feel the responsibility after reading the letter from Hu," said Zhang, now teaching in Qinghai.

Excited about the letter, Zhao Rui, a member of the volunteers team who will start teaching in western regions in some two months, said he will strive to do better and learn more during the work.

Zhao had served as a volunteer teacher at a rural primary school in Gansu Province two years ago when he was a junior with a bachelor degree program at Peking University.

"I just can't forget the eyes of the school kids," said Zhao, referring to those children in his class in Gansu. "With President Hu's words in my heart...I believe no matter how hard it will be, I will surely do it better."















Australia has become one of China' s major partners in terms of training and development of talents and scientific innovation, China's Vice Minister of Education Du Yubo told Xinhua in a recent interview, adding that the two countries will continue to build a stronger relationship in education corporation.

The fourth China-Australia education joint work group meeting was held in Canberra on Monday. The meeting was jointly-chaired by Du and Robert Griew, the Australian Associate Secretary for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations. Xinhua reporters conducted an exclusive interview with Du after the conclusion of the meeting.

Du stressed the needs to constantly enrich the content of educational exchange, to enhance the level of educational cooperation, and to make greater efforts to deepen cultural exchanges between the two countries.

"Although the two countries differ in culture, value and characteristics, we face the same challenges in education development," Du told Xinhua.

"Being open, tolerant, cooperative and complementing to each other should be our choice."

"I believe we can infuse Australia-China education cooperation with new stimulus, thereby contributing to the two countries' cultural exchange."

During Monday's meeting, China and Australia signed a "Jointly Work Plan" to determine the priority areas of educational cooperation in the next two years.

Du said the contents of the future corporation plan is very sufficient, which includes issues regarding higher education, vocational education, Chinese language teaching and student exchange.

In the aspect of higher education, Du said China and Australia both agreed to continue exchanging information on higher education reform. China and Australia will also encourage top universities of both countries to further their corporations.

In student exchange, Du said both countries agree they should develop a safety handbook for Chinese students in Australia, while China will also explore effective ways to increase the number of Australian students in China.

In aspect if promoting Chinese language teaching, Du said Australia will try to promote Chinese teaching in primary and secondary schools. At the same time, China will continue to support the building of Confucius Institutes and classes in Australia and will find ways to raise the number of qualified institutions for learning Chinese.

"I have briefly introduced three areas of the plan with examples. Some contents are really specific," he said.

"The next two years will be our base for cooperation and policy implementation."

Meanwhile, Du praised Australia's efforts in trying to perfect its policies and laws to secure Chinese students' interest and rights, building a stable environment for studying and living.

At the same time, he also reminded Chinese students to be prudent about studying overseas and choose institutions of quality. He urged Chinese students to abide by laws in the countries where they study and learn how to protect themselves in foreign countries.

Du expressed broad prospects on the future of the development between the two countries, saying that he firmly believes Australia and China can complement each other, and both have great potentials to cooperate in the education field.












A local woman with a porcelain pot approached Ding Yuanhai in Harbin. She told Ding, director of the Cultural Heritage Forensic Evaluation Institute of Heilongjiang Museum, that her antique had been appraised at 100,000 yuan ($15,400). And she had a document to prove it, provided and signed by an expert she had found through connections in Beijing.

Ding and his colleagues looked over the item and broke the news: The pot was counterfeit. The woman had no chance of recovering the 20,000 yuan appraisal fee she paid to the "expert" in the capital.

"She fell onto the chair and sat there, fixed, when she heard the 'antique' was a fake," Ding said. "I felt so sorry..."

More than 1 million items have been submitted to Ding and his colleagues for review at the institute over the last two years. The institute is the only organization in the province entitled to conduct forensic appraisals, which are used for court proceedings.

"We could only guarantee 61 items of those submitted and we handed out credentials to the owners," Ding said.

China's legitimate art and relics market is thriving. Last year it overtook the United Kingdom's to become the second largest market worldwide, according to an annual report by the European Fine Arts Foundation. Its value doubled from 2009, reaching 9.8 billion euros (91.2 billion yuan, $14 billion) and a 23 percent global share, the foundation said.

The counterfeit market is booming, too. According to a recent report from Beijing Business Today, about 300,000 people work in China's fake antiques market, which generated more than 10 billion yuan in 2009 and 2010.

Common people still dream of making a fortune by buying and selling true relics, but there is little help available to guide and protect them.










Investing in antiques, like investing in real estate, has swept the country in the past 10 years as a means of accumulating wealth. But it works only if the investment is well placed. That requires expert appraisal, which can be hard to find.

In China, the people who are consulted to appraise antiques generally fall into four groups: museum researchers who have been absorbed in their fields for decades, other employees of well-regarded museums, professors in archaeology academies and people who work in antique stores.

Song Zhaolin, a researcher at the National Museum of China, puts his faith only in the first group, his own. Through his experience in research, he values the years of familiarity with genuine collections.

A 70-year-old who researched and repaired relics for years at a different museum cautioned that working for a museum does not necessarily qualify people for appraisals. "They may brag they are working in a famous place, but their real jobs may only cover repairing the plumbing," said the man, who would not let his name be used.

Archaeology professors are well trained to recognize and safeguard ancient relics, but may not be familiar with the current market or setting monetary values.

China's Cultural Market Development Center used to provide consultations on antiques, but in April it canceled all appraisal services for individual collectors. It gave no explanation.

The China Association of Collectors connects people who share an interest in collecting, but it does not provide appraisal services to the public, an association officer told China Daily.

Local cultural departments make judgments about items in terms of how they can be shipped abroad, but that is only for customs purposes.

Some antique auction firms have their own appraisers or hire specialists they are familiar with to judge whether items are genuine. In that sense they are not independent appraisers, but the works they are valuing generally are intended for sale at auction. These specialists may or may not also evaluate items for individuals.

Yang Ziming, the principal appraiser at Ji Gu Relics Evaluation Center in the Liulichang Cultural Relics Street, charges 50 to 100 yuan for an oral evaluation, a lower rate than others posted at nearby shops. He said he can help a customer find appraisers with much more experience and fees to match, about 20,000 yuan.

Down the street, Wang Yunrong, an appraiser at Beijing Aoya Technological and Trade Co, told China Daily he can verify the genuineness of jade, Chinese water paintings, porcelains, coins and other items. So can the other two appraisers he works with, he said.

When asked about his qualifications, Wang said that he was called upon to confiscate antiques from the rich during a campaign before the "cultural revolution" (1966-1976).

In his shop, he said, "Every one of us has abundant knowledge about all fields."

Song, the National Museum researcher, views expertise differently. A true expert has general knowledge about many spheres of his field, he said, but specializes in just one or two.

"The number of real experts gets smaller nowadays as the old generation of appraisers pass away and the younger one has not yet grown up," Song said.











China's Xinhua News Agency and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) announced Friday in Beijing the launch of an international photo contest focusing on global fight against poverty.

Titled "Zoom in on Poverty International Photo Contest," the event is co-organized by the two agencies with an aim to arouse attention and win support from people and governments across the world for poverty eradication, organizers said at a press conference.

Photographers around the world, both amateur and professional, have been invited to submit works with anti-poverty themes from Friday until Sept. 1, according to organizers.

The contest will conclude on Oct. 17, the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. An award ceremony will be held in Beijing on that day.

The best entries will be presented to the public via the Xinhua newswire network and its affiliated magazines, newspapers and TV network, as well as through online platforms and showrooms in UN agencies around the world.

According to a statement from Li Congjun, president of Xinhua News Agency, the contest aims to focus the world's attention on poverty through photos that portray the causes, solutions and achievements made in the global anti-poverty campaigns over the past ten years, and as a responsible media group, Xinhua is shouldering its own responsibility in the international action to eradicate extreme poverty.

Li, who is also honorary chairman of the contest's organizing committee,

said in the statement that the contest will unite Xinhua, the UNDP and other media institutions around the world to make a contribution in promoting the common progress of mankind.

Addressing the press conference, Wang Yao, chairwoman of the contest's Board of Judges and deputy editor-in-chief of Xinhua, said the event is dedicated to taking a deep and broad look at the global challenge of poverty through photography.

"The language of photography goes beyond the barriers among different races, nationalities, countries and cultures and boasts distinctive advantages in reflecting global issues," Wang said.

Silvia Morimoto, deputy country director of UNDP China, said she hopes that in showcasing development experiences from around the world, "the competition will inspire participants to experience first-hand, the extraordinary impact that poverty reduction can have on people's lives."

She said Xinhua's global influence will attract the world's attention to poverty and offer a great contribution to achieving the Millennium Development Goals through the contest.

According to organizers, Li proposed the contest at the start of this year and received an active response from the UNDP shortly thereafter.

This is the third global humanitarian event that Xinhua, an international media group headquartered in Beijing, has sponsored through cooperation with UN institutions over the past three years.

Xinhua co-organized a special report along with the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) last year to mark the World Food Day on Oct. 16.

On Nov. 20, 2009, Xinhua and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) jointly held a "Global News Day for Children," a 24-hour news reporting campaign that marked the Universal Children's Day.

At the September 2000 Millennium Summit, leaders from all 191 UN members signed an agreement to commit themselves to combating poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy, environmental degradation and discrimination against women. They agreed to cut poverty in half before 2015 from the 1990 level.

Known as the Millennium Declaration, the agreement included eight specific goals, such as eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, achieving universal primary school education, reducing child mortality and ensuring environmental sustainability.











A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Education (MOE) said Friday that schools should use "democratic channels" and seek feedback from teachers and students before naming teaching buildings.

Spokeswoman Xu Mei said this in response to recent heated debate over the naming of a Tsinghua University teaching building after a well-known clothes brand, Jeanswest.

People said the university was "selling itself" which was indicative of the "falling spirit of universities," while others said it was normal for campus buildings to be named after a donor.

Xu said according to a regulation of the then State Education Commission in 1997, titles of teaching buildings and classrooms should not be named after individuals or enterprises, and any exceptions had to be approved by the higher authorities.

However, the State Council, or the Cabinet, abolished the MOE's right for examining and approving names of school buildings in 2004.

"The MOE appreciates education donations, and hopes that donors and recipients can negotiate names that reflect both gratitude towards donors and schools' development orientations," she added.









China's art sales reached 169.4 billion yuan (26 billion U.S. dollars) last year, up 41 percent from 2009, according to an annual report on the art market.

The report, released by the Ministry of Culture on Friday, quoted the European Fine Art Foundation as saying that China overtook Britain last year to become the world's second biggest art and antique market, with a 23 percent share of the global art business.

The domestic art market has been increasing rapidly, making it imperative to step up legal work and carry out routine supervision on the sector, said the report.









The second sports games for foreigners living in this capital city of Jilin province kicked off here on Saturday with over 400 athletes from 69 countries and regions participating.

The two-day competition features 18 disciplines from six sports including soccer, basketball, badminton, table tennis and shooting.

Most of the participants are foreign professionals, technical and management personnel, students and teachers living in Changchun.

Sola Kembo Christian of Congo said, "It is the first time for me to attend this games. I feel good and never want to lose any matches."

Thomas Ilisz of Germany, who plays badminton, said, "It is a very good competition, which can provide a chance for us to gather here to enjoy sports. I hope same competition will be held in next year."

More than 8,000 foreigners are living in Changchun.












 A newly-published 100-volume collection of works on Buddhist medicine was unveiled Saturday at the Shaolin Temple, the shrine of Kong Fu in central China's Henan Province.

China Buddhist Medicine Collection, compiled in 101 volumes and 70 million characters, includes more than 3,000 documents on the theories and practices of Buddhist medicine.

The earliest of the works dates to the Han Dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD), while the latest was written during the Republic of China (1912 - 1949).

"We use medicines to cure people's physical illnesses and Buddhism to solve their mental problems; the combination of the two is aimed to restore the balance and harmony of man's body and spirit," said Shi Yongxin, abbot of Shaolin and one of the principal compilers.

To complete the collection, the Shaolin Temple also offered its manuscripts on medicines, some of which had not been revealed to the public before, said Shi.

The Shaolin Temple, usually deemed the birthplace of Kong Fu, is also renowned for its achievements in orthopedics and traumatology.










Actors prepare to go upon stage at the Snowland Gyaebo Langma Hall in Lhasa, capital of southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, early May 6, 2011. The word "Langma" in Tibetan language means courtly performance, which in the past was only an entertainment for Tibetan traditional aristocracy. However, the present langma hall eventually evolved into a place of part bar, part folk concert hall and part ballroom, where common Tibetan people go for relaxation and gathering. Over the past 60 years, Tibet has witnessed rapid development in its modernization course. More and more modern elements merged into local people's daily lives, and gradually turned into a new page of the Tibetan charm. Across the plateau region, icons of traditional Tibetan culture are seen side by side with Coca Cola and Budweiser billboards, designer clothing outlets and pop music albums by Chinese and international stars. At the countryside of Tibet, farmers and herders enjoy their new life in commodious houses. Since 2006 the government of Tibet Autonomous Region has relocated farmers and herders who lived in remote and barren areas to places with better natural environments and transport facilities. Over the past five years, about 275,000 households in Tibet received assistance from the government to build new houses. In the urban areas, Tibetan people are passionate about the modern life while maintaining their traditions. Increasing demand for commercial performances and entertainments led to a boom in private art troupes in the past decades, such as the hilarious langma halls, making life on the plateau more and more colorful. Tibet now has more than 500 private troupes, which fostered a large number of professional actors to inherit the old arts. Traditional Tibetan arts have been well preserved and further developed while more and more young people showed interests in modern art. Fashionable digital products, like Apple Inc.'s iPhone, soon became a craze for young Tibetans just like elsewhere in the world. With better living conditions, higher incomes, and closer connection to the world, the lifestyle of Tibetan people has undergone great progress within a short span of time, towards modernity and diversity. 










Marriage is always hard work, more so when it comes to a wedding that involves a union of very different cultures, families and countries. The China Daily Sunday team files this special report on cross-cultural marriages today.
There are now about 600,000 foreigners working and living in China, a number not including those visiting for less than three months. On the other side of the coin, 1.91 million Chinese have chosen to further their studies overseas since 1978 right up to last year, according to the Ministry of Education. Slightly more than 630,000 have returned to China, but that still means 1.27 million Chinese are still living, working or studying abroad. These are mere numbers. When translated into living, breathing terms, it means intimate interaction between Chinese and non-Chinese is now greater than ever - and a natural result of that contact is the increase in cross-cultural relationships, and of marriages.

While cross-cultural marriages are not new, the nature of the union is changing. The playing field is more level, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the growing numbers of foreign women marrying Chinese men, as Mary Katherine Smith finds out in Shanghai.

It is a very different world from when Dan Waters married his Chinese bride 50 years ago. "Never marry a Chinese woman," he jokes wryly, quoting the late Australian journalist Richard Hughes. "They're steel rods swathed in flowers."

Neither Hughes nor Waters paid any attention to this homily, and if Waters was not personally in a cross-cultural marriage, he would never have written One Couple, Two Cultures, a study of 81 Western and Chinese couples, as he tells Rebecca Lo in Hong Kong.

It is also in Hong Kong that we discover the author of yet another book, The Eurasian Face. Kirsteen Zimmern herself is the product of a mixed marriage, which failed, unfortunately.

She is married to another Eurasian, and she credits the contentment of their union to a shared understanding of surviving a household with two cultures.

Contributor Donna Mah shares a first-person account of how she "married a nice Chinese boy" according to her grandmother's advice and found that cultural differences are not shut out by ethnicity, but can result from a different nurturing environment even when you are of the same race. But some seek comfort in familiarity. In Beijing, Cang Wei finds out how pragmatic the current generation of young Chinese can be, with most saying they will think hard before taking a leap into the unknown and unfamiliar.

In this special report, we let the couples committed to cross-cultural marriages tell their stories - tales that reflect the globalization shrinking distances between cultures and people. It is also about maturing attitudes, and the shattering of traditional stereotypes that can only bring about a better understanding of how we can all live together in harmony.










More than 100 kite enthusiasts from over 20 countries and regions have gathered here for the 2011 International Kite Invitational Tournament.

The fans from the United States, Germany, France, Holland, Hungary, Austria, Switzerland, South Korea and Vietnam are contesting in three categories - kite flying, kite fighting and sport kite ballet along with more than 300 local kite lovers.

Hans Peter Boehme, the Vice President of the International Kite Federation, was among the participants. He has visited China 15 times for kite-related activities.

Boehme said that as known to all, China is the birthplace of kite art and he is very interested in the history of kite art, and enjoys the various kite competitions held in China.

According to the State General Administration of Sport of China, in recent years kite competitions held in China witnessed an increase in the participation of foreign kite enthusiasts.

"Sports have no boundaries, and it is incredible for the foreigners to design such special and unique kites," said Cheng Xu, a kite lover from North China's Shaanxi Province.

The kite art originated from the Spring and Autumn Period (770 B.C. to 475 B.C.) and was used to transmit information in the first place before it then developed into a kind of leisure sport.










 Cabs are fully booked and demand for hotel rooms has risen as parents strive to make next week's college entrance exam days as stress-free as possible for their offspring.

Shanghai's four major taxi fleets sold out within eight hours advance bookings for the three-day exam period from Tuesday to Thursday.

Exams also drive up the demand for hotel rooms, especially hourly rated ones, near test centers, as parents seek comfortable surroundings where their children can rest.

Some customers have asked not to have cabs or rooms with the numbers 4 and 6, which sound like "death" and "failing the exam" in Shanghai dialect.

Many parents have asked for leave from work to accompany their children to the exams.

"Twelve years' study is all for this test," said Huang Fengjuan, mother of a test taker. "I will be sad if I cannot accompany my son."

The city environmental authority has ordered all construction sites to cease operations at night until the exams end. And workers at construction sites near test centers will down tools while students are sitting exams.

Thousand of traffic policemen will patrol around test centers reminding drivers not to sound their horns.

Almost 61,000 people applied to sit the exam this year, down from 66,000 last year, the Shanghai Educational Examinations Authority said.










 China's northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will recruit around 9,200 bilingual primary and middle school teachers this year to promote bilingual education, local education authorities said Tuesday.

Xinjiang will hire 11,502 primary and middle school teachers in 2011 in total, 80 percent of whom can speak both Mandarin and a language of an ethnic group, the region's education department said in a press release.

This is the largest such recruitment in six years for urban and rural schools in 83 counties, cities or districts in the autonomous region, it said.

In an education development plan unveiled last October, the regional government pledged to offer bilingual education in Mandarin as well as Uygur or other ethnic languages for all 2.6 million primary and middle school students of ethnic groups by 2020.

According to the plan, this will help ethnic group students gain a command of the national language upon graduation from high school and prepare them better for jobs or higher education.









China is seeing an increase in the use of synthetic drugs such as crystal methamphetamine, also known as "ice," according to an annual report released by the country's drug watchdog on Thursday.

The State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) said in its 2010 drug abuse monitoring report that the abuse of other drugs, such as heroin, has decreased over time.

However, heroin and crystal meth were still the two most widely-used illegal drugs last year, according to the report.

The report also showed that the abuse of narcotics and psychotropic substances originally intended for medical use remained at a comparatively low level.

"The situation of drug prohibition is still grim, and the task of coping with drug abuse is difficult," the report said.

According to previous reports, illegal activity related to the use of synthetic drugs like crystal meth and ketamine has increased in recent years.

The report stated that police seized more crystal meth than heroin in 16 of China's 31 provincial-level regions last year.

Police records showed that China had 432,000 synthetic drug abusers by the end of 2010, accounting for 28 percent of the country's drug abusers. Last year saw 118,000 more synthetic drug abusers than 2009.










Four out of 167 meat samples were found to contain sulphur dioxide, a banned preservative for meat, according to a report made public Thursday by the Center for Food Safety of Hong Kong.

Samples of beef, pork and mutton were collected at local fresh provision shops and market stalls in February and March for a targeted surveillance project.

The sulphur dioxide found in the four fresh meat samples, including three fresh beef and one fresh pork, were at levels ranging from 22 parts per million ppm to 470 parts per million ppm, according to the center's report, saying the overall satisfactory rate was 97.6 percent.

The results of the three fresh beef samples had been announced in the Food Safety Reports for February and March.

The center has taken follow-up action, including collecting follow-up samples and issuing warning letters to the shop operators concerned.

Following repeated detections of sulphur dioxide in fresh meat samples in recent years, the center continued to conduct the targeted surveillance project this year to assess of the use of the preservative, a spokesman for the center said.

"Individual meat traders have been found using sulphur dioxide to make the meat look fresher," He said.

Under the city's Preservatives in Food Regulation, it is an offence to sell fresh, chilled or frozen meat containing sulphur dioxide, and the maximum penalty is a fine of 50,000 HK dollars ( about 6,435 U.S. dollars) and six months' imprisonment.








 Eleven people went on trial Thursday accused of manufacturing and selling a fake eye medication that left 61 people suffering from adverse reactions in Shanghai.

Luwan District People's Court said the suspects concocted a counterfeit version of Avastin with regular saline and then used fake packaging to deceive buyers and gain illegal profits.

All 90 bottles of the fake drugs were later sold to the Shanghai Ruijin-AmMed Cancer Center, a joint venture between Shanghai Ruijin Hospital and AmMed Cancer Center of Hong Kong, according to the court.

The cancer center then sold five bottles to the Shanghai No. 1 People's Hospital.

A total of 116 patients were given the counterfeit medication on Sept. 6 and 8 last year at the Shanghai No. 1 People's Hospital, previous investigations showed.

Of them, 61 experienced negative reactions, including eye pain, redness in the eyes, and unclear vision. All were later discharged from hospital following treatment and none suffered damage to their vision.

The court will announce the verdict on a later date.

In January, the presidents of Shanghai No.1 People's Hospital and Ruijin Hospital received disciplinary punishment and two eye doctors at the No.1 People's Hospital were suspended for six months.

In addition, Ruijin-AmMed Cancer Center had the illegal revenue confiscated and its medical license revoked.

Avastin is produced by the Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche Group and is designed to inhibit angiogenesis.










China's State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) issued a circular on Friday banning the use of Nimesulide, an anti-inflammatory drug, for children under the age of 12, considering potential side-effects such as liver and kidney damage.

Nimesulide is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that first became available in Italy in 1985. It is now used in more than 50 countries and regions.

The drug entered Chinese markets in 1997.

According to the SFDA, while common adverse reactions to the drug include vomiting and stomache, domestic and overseas statistics indicate that more severe issues are related to the drug, such as blood coagulation disorders, decreased white blood cells and damage to liver and kidney.

Previously, the SFDA only prevented the use of the drug among children one year old or younger.

Also on Friday, the SFDA ordered the suspension of the production, sales and use of Duxil (almitrine and raubasine compound) due to its "unobvious" efficacy.

According to the SFDA, clinical research found "little" evidence proving the drug effectively improves the cognitive ability for patients suffering vascular cognitive impairment.

The drug was supposed to treat symptoms related to cognition and sensory nerve damage.

The moves came after a two-month nationwide campaign was launched earlier this month to probe the quality of essential drugs and ensure drug safety.

Official figures show that China's National Center for Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring received 692,904 reports of adverse reactions in 2010, up 8.4 percent compared with those in 2009.

Among the total, 109,991 cases involved new or severe adverse reactions, a year-on-year increase of 16.2 percent.












China's Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Tuesday that the country will inject 30 billion yuan (4.6 billion U.S. dollars) this year to fund basic public health services.

Qin Huaijin, director of Women/Children Health and Community Health Department under the MOH, said at a press conference that the funds will be used to upgrade 10 programs and offer more free health services for the public.

The new programs will provide basic health care services such as regular physical examinations and vaccinations for all children under the age of 6, while the previous services only benefited children under 3, Qin said.

Under the government-funded programs, each child can have a total of 13 free basic health services at grassroots clinics until they turn 6. Services include growth evaluation and guidance for children's growth.

Any child under 6 can have 14 types of vaccinations free of charge.

The programs also offer free services to pregnant women and people over 65, such as regular and comprehensive physical examinations, according to Qin.

Pregnant women can have a total of five visits for free health care services prior to delivery, which includes a comprehensive physical examination consisting of a gynecology examination and blood and urine tests.

Individuals over 65 are eligible for one free health care visit each year, which includes a health assessment and a comprehensive physical examination.

Qin emphasized that the above-basic health care services would benefit all of the public, including migrant workers and their families.

Moreover, the funds will also be used to improve the food safety monitoring system of grassroots medical institutions in communities, villages and towns, who will report food-related health incidents to authorities immediately.

"To find and report food safety information will be a major duty of grassroots medical institutions because they have more contact with everyday people," Qin said.

In April 2009, China unveiled a three-year plan for national health care reform with an investment of at least 850 billion yuan and an emphasis on the nature of public benefits.

The government announced it would increase the per capita funding for basic public health services from 15 yuan to 25 yuan this year.











The prices of Chinese herbal medicine have gone up sharply across the board in China over recent months.

According to figures from the China Association of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 84 percent of 537 types of traditional medicine were the subject of a price hike in 2010. The selling price of 96 of them at least doubled.

Shen Jianhua, president of the Liwan District Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine, was quoted by the English newspaper China Daily that the average prescription at his hospital rose from 84 yuan (12.7 U.S. dollars) last year to 102.7 yuan in April.

"The big price rise will affect a lot of people who consult traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) doctors after they fall ill," said Wen Zhangbin, who had just taken his three-year-old grandson to see a TCM practitioner at a hospital in Guangzhou, capital of southern China's Guangdong Province.

TCM has a lot of followers in the city, because many people believe it is not only effective but cheaper than Western medicine, 63-year-old Wen said.

At a bazaar where herbal medicine is sold in Guangzhou's Qingping, a kilogram of taizishen now sells for more than 500 yuan but was less than 50 yuan at the beginning of 2010. Taizishen is mainly used in the treatment of children's cough and fever.

A trader surnamed Li at the Qingping bazaar said the serious drought that hit southwest China last year and the north China plain earlier this year meant less herbal medicine was produced.

Meanwhile, many herbal medicine growers have refused to plant herbs used in Chinese medicine because of the high cost of fertilizers and farm chemicals.

Xing Zhenjie, general manager of Bozhou Zhenjie Medicine Company based in Anhui Province, said part of the problem is the fact that the price of traditional medicine can be easily manipulated.

"Some medicines can only be planted in certain areas, so, if all products are bought by one investor or a group of them, speculating on those products is quite easy," he said.

Xing said people are buying up stocks so they can drive up the price.

"The shelf life of some products is 20 years, so many people, including planters, hoard medicine as a way of speculating and that drives up prices," said Xing. "There is no standardized shelf time for traditional Chinese medicine so people will not worry about an expiry date."

Jiang Yanghua, an analyst from China Investment Consulting, said it is necessary to establish a price and production monitoring mechanism to oversee the market. In addition, Jiang said a reserve mechanism would help ease the pressure when the price goes up even higher.













Wang Jun, a resident in Tai'an, east China's Shandong Province, has been smoking for more than 20 years. In April 2010, his wife was diagnosed with lung cancer, and the news hit the chain-smoking Wang like a thunderbolt.

He realized his smoking habit was at least partially responsible.

"I know my wife's cancer is closely related to my second-hand smoke," Wang said.

China produced nearly 2.4 trillion cigarettes in 2010, which contributed more than 7 percent of the nation's annual total tax income, yet more than one million died of tobacco-related diseases, accounting for 13 percent of the total 9.43 million of deaths in 2010.

China has more than 300 million smokers, and those smokers are not only damaging their own health. Second-hand smoke attacks about 740 million people, including 180 million children and teenagers, according to the 2011 China Tobacco Control Report released by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) Thursday in Beijing.

More than one million people die every year from smoking-related diseases, and more than 100,000 of those cases can be traced back to second-hand smoke, the report said.

Despite his wife's cancer, Wang persists in the deadly habit, only now, he smokes outside so he won't further affect his 43-year-old wife.

TOBACCO LOWERS LIFE EXPECTANCY

China's 12th Five-Year Plan endeavors to increase the average life expectancy one year, to 74.5 years. The government has also promised to ban smoking in public places "in an all-around manner" - the first time an anti-smoking measure has been included in its five-year plan.

Jiang Yuan, deputy director of the Tobacco Control Office of the China CDC, said cancer has become the number one cause of death, as lung cancer and coronary heart disease are afflicting young adults.

More than 7,000 chemicals have been discovered in tobacco smoke, of which 250 are harmful, and 70 may cause cancer, research has shown.

"About 25 percent of men will die of smoking-related disease," Jiang added.

World Health Organization chief Margaret Chan Fung Fu-chun said last year that tobacco use can kill in so many ways that it is a risk factor for six of the eight leading causes of death in the world.

According to the tobacco-control report, secondhand smoke can be lethal for non-smokers, as it causes cancer, cardiovascular diseases and respiratory diseases, and increases the risk of heart disease by 25-30 percent and lung cancer 20-30 percent.

Second-hand smoke also leads to the sudden death of newborns, the report said.

Hu Angang, director of the Center for China Studies at Tsinghua University, said that about 2.4 trillion yuan of economic burden in the year of 2005 was caused by tobacco-related diseases, accounting for 13.1 percent of the annual GDP.

REGULATION IS A MUST

Voluntary smoking controls have proved ineffective, with laws and regulations being the only effective way of curbing the habit, according to the report.

Although the government has adopted the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC), implementation is slow largely due to the interference of the tobacco industry, health experts said.

"Voluntary smoking control was a compromise advocated by the tobacco industry, which was under pressure of public criticism at the time," said Liang Xiaofeng, deputy director of the China CDC.

A local draft law that bans indoor smoking in public areas was passed on Thursday in Harbin, the capital city of Heilongjiang Province, which is considered to be an important milestone in reducing the harm caused by second-hand smoke.

Indoor smoking control regulations in Tianjin, Chongqing, Nanchang, Shenzhen and Shenyang are also being discussed or awaiting a vote.

"Everyone is privileged to protect oneself from being harmed by second-hand smoke, which is the aim of legislation," said Li Wei, an official with Tianjin Centers for Diseases Control (Tianjin CDC) and Prevention. "The tobacco-control law never deprives the right of smoking."

In February, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television (SARFT) ordered film and TV studios to restrict smoking scenes and to ban shots showing tobacco brands or minors in scenes while others are smoking.

Also in March, a revised regulation on health management in public places issued by the Ministry of Health said smoking would be banned in enclosed public locations, which took effect on May 1.

Yang Gonghuan, a tobacco-control expert and the deputy director of the China CDC, said government policy is one but not the only important part of tobacco-control initiatives.

A survey conducted by the China CDC shows less than 25 percent of the population have a thorough knowledge of the harm posed by smoking and second-hand smoke.

"Raising public awareness and urging them to join in tobacco-control efforts remains the key to success." Yang said.


















Parents of children with cerebral palsy are going to have a place to turn for help, as the first public foundation to provide aid has been set up in northern Shanxi Province.
The Brain Rehabilitation Fund was established on Saturday by the China Population Welfare Foundation (CPWF), which is headquartered in Beijing. The CPWF will cooperate with the Shanxi Cerebral Palsy Hospital, which specializes in curing the brain disease with therapies such as acupuncture and massage.

Lan Ye, the deputy secretary general of the CPWF, said the fund aims to relieve the burden of affected families by providing financial assistance and training so parents are able to do the therapy at home. In addition, the fund hopes to reduce the incidence of cerebral palsy by publicizing preventative measures to thwart the disease.

More than 6 million suffer from cerebral palsy in China, and among them more than 2 million are children, said Guo Xinzhi, vice president of the Shanxi's Federation of the Disabled.

"A family needs to spend more than 500,000 yuan (77,000 U.S. dollars) to cure a child with the disease," Guo said. "As 70 percent of the children with cerebral palsy are from poor, mountainous areas, more than 25.7 percent of families cannot afford to pay the medical expenses."

On Saturday, 25 parents from Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Fujian, Henan and Shanxi provinces came to the hospital for free training on helping their children to recover at home.














After taking blood tests, a flock of residents were standing before a bulletin board of the local clinic, reading a list of medical expenses covered by the country's new rural cooperative medical system in Liantang village of Xing'an County, South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.

"In the past, I had to see village doctors and pay all the medical fees if I got ill. But now both the county and the village have new clinics with expenses partially covered by the government. It's a good thing indeed," said a 68-year-old villager named Ouyang Qiurong.

Medical care improvements like in Liantang can also be seen in other rural areas, thanks to the country's continuous efforts to improve its basic medical care system.

The system has so far covered 1.26 billion residents, or 90 percent of the total population as the country works to develop rural medical services, establish a basic medicine system and run trials for the public hospital reform to provide more convenient and affordable medical services.

LARGEST-EVER SOCIAL WELFARE

In 2005, China's basic medical care system for urban residents and the new rural cooperative medical care system covered about only 300 million people, leaving a large number of rural populations untended, which became a primary concern for the country.

To provide more effective, convenient and affordable medical services, the government decided to deepen the medical care system reform in 2009.

Now, the basic medical care system benefits 430 million urban residents, and the new rural cooperative medical care system covers 830 million rural residents.

"The country has established a basic medical care system that nearly covers the whole nation in only five years. It took Germany a hundred years and the Republic of Korea 12 years to achieve the goal. China has created a record, " said Yao Lan, professor with the School of Medicine under the Huazhong University of Science and Technology.
















Li Xiaofeng, a patient taking hemodialysis in Boai Hospital in Changchun, the capital of China's northeast Jilin Province, has been ill for the past three years. Medical treatments almost cost every penny she had.

"I wanted to commit suicide several times. But I feel hopeful now," she said. From February 2011, Changchun launched a medical care system reform, which enabled her to take hemodialysis for 400 yuan (61.64 U.S. dollar) a year.

"Lack of government investments has long been the major cause for the country's poor medical care system. The latest reform has changed the situation," said Xu Guangjian, deputy dean of the School of Public Administration under the Renmin University of China, adding that the government has been more aware of funding public service over recent years.

According to Vice Minister of Finance Wang Jun, the country invested 1.13 trillion yuan in improving the medical care system during 2009-2011, 284.2 billion yuan more than the original budget. It also raised the ratio of the medical care spending in fiscal expenditure to 5.35 percent in 2011, up from 4.57 percent in 2008.

Also, rural health services were improved over the past years as the government allocated 40 billion yuan to support the construction of 1,877 county-level hospitals, 7,000 grassroots medical care institutions and 11,000 village clinics.

















Despite the fast development, the country still has a long way to go to establish a high-standard medical care system, according to Yao.

"Currently, there is still a big gap between the rural and urban medical care systems. Even the urban system needs improvements such as raising reimbursement ratio, covering more drug expenditures and providing more medical services," he said.

In the country's 12th Five-Year Plan (2011-2015) period, China will work to reduce individual's shares of total medical expenditures to less than 30 percent.

Also, the maximum reimbursement for urban residents will reach six times of their annual disposable incomes in 2011, and no lower than 50,000 yuan, while annual medical treatment allowances for both urban and rural residents will rise to 200 yuan per capita from the current 120 yuan.

Further, the government will continue to push forward the reform of public hospitals in the interest of public benefits while focusing on separating medical treatment services and medicine sales, which is believed as the primary cause for high costs in public hospitals.

In addition to a basic medical care system, the country also aims to build a basic health care system that will cover both the urban and rural residents and cater to different demands by 2020.













About 80 percent of China's primary and middle school students aren't getting enough sleep, according to a report leased on Monday in north China's Tianjin Municipality.

The average sleeping time for China's elementary and middle school students is less than eight hours, even on weekends, according to the report released by the China Youth and Children Research Center (CYCRC).

The report was based on three surveys of more than 5,000 elementary and middle school students in ten provincial-level regions. The surveys were conducted in 1999, 2005 and 2010.

"Heavy workloads, poor study habits and long commute times have all contributed to the sleep shortage," said Deng Xiquan, a scholar who works with the CYCRC.

According to the CYCRC, elementary and middle school students should get ten and nine hours of sleep each day, respectively.











China's Ministry of Health, as well as five other governmental bodies, issued a joint public health notice on Monday which included a ban on the use of Bisphenol A (BPA) in the production of infant feeding bottles.

China will prohibit the manufacture of feeding bottles containing BPA from June 1 this year, the notice said. Imports and sales of bottles containing BPA will be banned starting from Sept. 1, according to the notice.

The notice also asks local food security inspectors to be vigilant against any possible violations of the ban.

BPA, an organic compound that is used to make polycarbonate plastic and other materials, may lead to premature sexual development in children, according to researchers.

The chemical is widely used in the production of infant feeding bottles, tableware and beverage containers.













The number of nurses in China has increased substantially over the past five years, with the country's longtime nurse shortage being addressed, an official of the Ministry of Health said Tuesday.

China currently has nearly 2.05 million nurses, up 52 percent from that of 2005, said Guo Yanhong, vice director of the ministry's medical administration division, at a press conference.

There were about 1.52 nurses per 1,000 people in 2010, up from 1.06 five years ago, Guo said.

However, Guo said the current doctor-to-nurse ratio stood at 1 to 1.16 in 2010, still below the World Bank's proposed standard of being above 1 to 2 on average.

To improve the quality of nursing in Chinese hospitals, Guo said the ministry would launch a campaign to focus on basic nursing duties, the monitoring of patients' health and treatment and rehabilitation services.












Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to take heavy-handed measures following food safety violations.

Li, also head of the food safety commission under the State Council, or China's Cabinet, made the remarks Friday at the conclusion of a nine-day seminar on food safety, which was attended by chief officials at ministry and province levels.

Li urges adopting strict and harsh punishments for food safety violations in order to deter violations in the most effective manner.

"Offenders in the food safety area should receive their due consequences for the violations," Li said.

Li also urges improving the enterprise responsibility system in the food sector.

All food enterprises should be covered in a food safety credit system, and those that have seriously violated the law and regulations should be closed and prohibited from entering the food sector in the future, Li said.

He also called on government departments to intensify supervision and to leave no "blind spot" in the supervision.

"Cases of official's malpractice in the food safety area should be seriously investigated and punished," he said.

Moreover, Li called for better transparency in food safety information to respond to the public's concerns and deal with food safety emergencies in the timeliest manner.

"Over the past decades, China has managed to provide the people with sufficient food, and we must make efforts to provide them with safe food," Li said.

He also stressed that promoting food safety in China will help boost the domestic and international market of various Chinese products, as well as maintain social harmony.













 China's health authorities will intensify its crackdown on the illegal adding of non-edible materials to food and tighten supervision against abuse of food additives, according to a circular issued by the Ministry of Health.

The ministry in the circular issued Monday demanded greater efforts from local health administration agencies in investigating and handling of cases that involve the adding of non-edible materials to food.

A system for reporting food safety incidents and organizing investigations should be created by local health authorities, the circular said.

The ministry also urged health authorities to improve their emergency response system for food safety accidents and include experts in their investigation teams.

Local health authorities should better work with other government agencies to root out those inspection or certification agencies responsible for dereliction of duty in food safety cases, the circular said.

China has blacklisted 151 materials forbidden in food or which have been improperly used in food for human consumption and livestock feed over the past nine years, according to figures released by the food safety committee under the State Council, or China's cabinet.

The materials include 47 inedible materials that may be added illegally to food for human consumption, 22 food additives that are easily abused and 82 substances forbidden in feed and drinking water for animals.

The health ministry stressed in the circular that those blacklisted non-edible materials and additives should become the key targets during food safety supervision of health administration authorities at various levels.

"Tests should be conducted immediately, if any non-edible materials or abuse of food additives are found in food during investigations into rare illnesses with suspected links to tainted food," the circular said.

The country's cabinet recently ordered an intensified crackdown on the illegal use of non-edible materials in food.

Non-edible materials are banned from use in food, said the circular posted last week on the official website of China's central government.

Use of any food additive or flavoring that are uncertified or bear no standard information as to its manufacturers, or overuse of such materials, are also prohibited, the State Food and Drug Administration said.

These moves came after a series of food safety scandals including clenbuterol-tainted pork and dyed steamed buns have surfaced in recent months despite Chinese authorities' efforts to revamp the country's food industry.













A national school milk program intended to improve children's health has soured again.

On Friday morning, 251 children at Yuhe Town Central Primary School in Yulin, Shaanxi province, fell ill after drinking school milk produced by the Mengniu Dairy Group. They were sent to hospital for treatment, and were all discharged by the following day.

Test results released on Tuesday afternoon said the milk met China's national standards for food safety, and no pathogens were detected in the milk or the students' vomit and feces. They did not say why 251 students suffered from the discomforts collectively.

The tests were conducted by Yulin's Center for Disease Control and Prevention and the results were announced by the city's food safety committee.

On Tuesday evening, Mengniu said on its website that it would work with the school and the local health department to track the students' health. But public confidence in China's developing school milk program suffered another blow.

Dairy enterprises are impaired by suspected and real poisoning incidents and low profits. Schools stay out of the program because they do not want to be implicated in safety scandals. And the country has no unified management or supervision of the program it started in 2000.

Milk producers and local watchdogs are the first to be blamed for bad quality control, but experts also have doubts about the guiding theory behind the program.













Mengniu breathed a corporate sigh of relief at the test report, but food safety experts didn't let it go easily.

"Why do accidents always happen at branch plants?" said Sang Liwei, a food-safety lawyer in Beijing and a representative of the Global Food Safety Forum, a non-governmental organization. The milk the Yulin children drank was processed at a local plant in Baoji that is owned by Inner Mongolia-based Mengniu. "One month ago," Sang said, "milk withdrawn from circulation was also produced by a subsidiary plant", that one in Zhengzhou, Henan province, and owned by Shanghai Bright Dairy & Food.

Mengniu was involved in two milk incidents in Shaanxi province within the past year, but test results for both set it free. Experts called for a new test by higher authorities.

Sang mentioned safety concerns at Nongfu Spring in Haikou, Hainan province, in 2009. Haikou Municipal Industrial and Commercial Bureau detected excessive mercury in the drinking water, but a later test by the provincial bureau showed the water met standards.

"No matter what happened behind the scenes, it at least showed that two tests can give different answers," Sang said.

Food safety experts said if the questioned milk indeed passed the tests, then the standard for dairy products in China is doubtful.

"We have two tests: qualitative and quantitative," Sang said. "Sanlu's baby formula had also been qualified before 2008, because there wasn't a test target for melamine," Sang said.

An estimated 300,000 infants, including six who died from kidney stones or other kidney damage, became victims of baby formula produced by Sanlu Group Co in 2008. The chemical melamine, which was added to the milk, caused it to appear to have a higher protein content.

So what really caused the Yulin schoolchildren to become ill?

Hours after the test results were announced, Mengniu suggested two possible reasons - the "unscientific" way the children drank the milk and hysteria, because "only 16 students vomited and felt nausea at first".

"After drinking the cold milk on an empty belly, some students experienced upper abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and other symptoms of gastritis," said Zhao Yuanhua, vice-president of Mengniu Dairy Group.

Parents were skeptical. "Is this blaming the children's poor physical condition? Could it be said that hundreds of students are all in poor condition?" Chen, parent of a third-grader, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying.

Zhao told China Daily there are other reasons to believe the milk was safe. "Students at another primary school in Hanzhong, Shaanxi province, drank 700 cartons of milk from the same batch, but none experienced discomfort."

Zhao said teachers at the Yulin school have said the symptoms appeared first among 16 students and then seemed to spread. "That might be caused by hysteria," he said.

Mental health experts said it can happen. "If several children began to vomit and have stomachaches, it's possible that hundreds of others may be influenced . . . and undergo a collective reaction," said Ji Xuesong, a professor at Peking University's institute of mental health.

"If some students showed symptoms like nausea and vomiting, a teacher should avoid asking if others have the same feelings," Zhao said. "Asking that may make more children get infected."














When China launched its national school milk program, nine ministries and bureaus established a coordination group, which is affiliated with the Ministry of Agriculture.

School milk carries special symbols on its packaging and cannot be sold in the marketplace. Authorized enterprises must pass expert evaluation and approval of the coordination group. The price of school milk must be lower than the market price of similar products in the same region.

"Direct delivery was compulsive, and the service was regulated," Wang Dingmian, former vice-chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Dairy Association, told China Daily on Monday. "But when the management system ended in 2003 and the administration and approval rights were passed on to local departments below the provincial level, problems began to erupt."

The incident with the widest impact happened in Haicheng, Liaoning province, in March 2003. A total of 3,936 students and 260 teachers in eight primary schools showed symptoms after drinking soymilk at school. A 13-year-old girl died.

An investigation found that the food poisoning was caused by the soy flour, the raw material used in soymilk.

Five years later, 152 children in several kindergartens in Zhuhai and Jiangmen, Guangdong province, were poisoned when they drank milk processed by Zhuhai Bigshot Dairy Co. The company did not meet the qualifications for supplying school milk but had long been a major supplier for local schools.

The Ministry of Health reported, "The milk was contaminated by a kind of coccus (bacterium) in the process of adding ingredients, and was not effectively disinfected."

Five incidents occurred in April 2010 in Shaanxi province. In two cases, investigations showed that the milk from Mengniu Dairy Group and another dairy giant, Yili Industrial Group, met national standards for food safety.

Shaanxi Renrengao Dairy, a private company based in Baoji, was the culprit in two of the cases. Its filling machines did not seal milk packages well, so air sneaked in and the milk spoiled.

The company had acquired a license for manufacturing of industrial products, a food hygiene license and ISO9001 quality management accreditation.

No reports were found about how the enterprises were punished. Bigshot and Renrengao have multiple product lines today.

In the fifth case, nine pupils at Qianwei town's Andai Primary School in Lantian county suffered abdominal pain after ingesting milk and eggs at school. No reports about the culprit were found.

















China will more than double its number of nurses to 4.45 million by 2020, according to a ten-year training blueprint published by the Ministry of Health on Thursday.

The ministry is set to train more pediatricians, psychiatrists,pharmacists, nurses and health supervision personnel from 2011 to 2020, as demand for more medical professionals continues to increase, the blueprint said.

The number of pharmacists is expected to hit 550,000 by 2015 and reach 850,000 by 2020,the blueprint says, adding that the current shortage of nurses and other medical professionals will be eliminated by 2020.

More than 4.6 million health and medical professionals will be working in China's smaller communities by 2020, it says.

China had 7.78 million health and medical professionals by the end of 2009. For every 1,000 Chinese citizens, there are 1.75 doctors and 1.39 nurses, according to statistics released by the ministry.











China will enhance its public education efforts in the next five years to promote scientific food safety knowledge, according to the country's food safety authority on Sunday.

Workers in food production industry must be trained before taking the job, said the executive office of the food safety commission under the State Council, the Cabinet, in a five-year program (2011-2015) for the country's food safety education work.

Employers and main employees are asked to receive concentrated training, no less than 40 hours a year, on laws, regulations, scientific knowledge and professional ethics concerning food safety, said the program.

Every regulator in charge of food safety monitoring work is also required to receive professional training for no less than 40 hours a year.

The program calls for establishing a long-term mechanism to strengthen public education efforts, with joint participation by government, enterprises, institutes, experts, consumers and the media.

By 2015, more than 80 percent of the public should be aware of basic food safety knowledge, and the rate for the primary and high school students should be up to 85 percent or more, said the program.

To achieve the above goal, concerned authorities should carry out more educational activities in communities, villages and schools, and improve information release system, said the program.

"Efforts will be made to reinforce management work of food producers, promote food safety awareness of the public, and strengthen law enforcement capability of the food safety regulators," the program said.

"A good atmosphere with every people devoted for safeguarding food safety will be set up," according to the program.












 A joint public health exercise was held on Monday by health and quarantine departments in Hong Kong and Shenzhen to enhance communication and coordination between the two cities ahead of the 26th Shenzhen Summer Universiade in August.

The exercise, code-named Jasper, was conducted by Hong Kong's Center for Health Protection of the Department of Health and Shenzhen Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Bureau at Shenzhen Bay Port, aiming to test the response of the two sides in the event of an infectious disease outbreak during the Universiade period.

The exercise operated in a scenario that one member in a group of 36 spectators was found to have fever and suspected to have contracted Disease X, a severe emerging disease spread by droplets.

Hong Kong's Customs and Excise Department, Fire Services Department, Immigration Department, Hong Kong Police Force and the Hong Kong Shenzhen Bay Port Facility Management Office also participated in the drill.

About 130 participants from government departments and organizations from Hong Kong and Shenzhen took part in the exercise, which was observed by about 200 experts from health authorities in Hong Kong, mainland and Macao.










A total of 28 out of 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions were free from iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) by the end of 2010, which removed China from the list of countries seriously suffering IDD, an official said on Tuesday.

Only three regions, including Tibet, Qinghai and Xinjiang in western China, had not completely eliminated IDD, but they "basically removed it," said Wang Bin, deputy director of the ministry's disease prevention and control bureau.

Statistics show that the coverage of iodized salt reached 98.6 percent in China. The government started an iodized salt program in 1995.

Iodine helps maintain the healthy working of the brain and nervous system, while deficiency can lead to various complications.

Iodine deficiency in pregnant or nursing mothers can lead to neurocognitive disorders in infants.













A spokesman with China's Ministry of Health (MOH) said Tuesday that no new or unknown viruses has been found so far in the country's self-proclaimed "HIV-Negative AIDS" group, and the cause of their AIDS-like symptoms had yet to be determined.

The statement, according to ministry spokesman Deng Haihua, was based on tests by domestic and overseas authoritative facilities.

The "HIV-Negative AIDS patients" said they had displayed symptoms very similar with AIDS, such as swollen lymph nodes, subcutaneous bleeding, joint pain, fatigue, night sweating and loss of weight.

They termed it "HIV-Negative AIDS," thinking they might have been suffering from a mutation of the AIDS virus, or a new unknown virus.

On Tuesday, Deng, citing the latest test on 60 such "patients," said no evidence suggested they were suffering from an infectious disease.

The new tests, conducted by a team led by Zhong Nanshan, a renowned medical expert, showed that these people had not been infected with the HIV virus.

The MOH first received reports of "HIV-Negative AIDS" in June 2009.

However, Zhong's tests found the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), a very common virus of the herpes virus family, in 55 percent of the patients, according to Deng.

"Further research needs to be conducted in order to determine whether the EBV is the cause of the group's symptoms," Deng said.

While some medical experts believe that the "patients" might suffer from some kind of psychological AIDS phobia, others said the possibility of finding a new virus in the future could not be ruled out.












A set of conjoined twin girls born in southwestern China with a single body and two heads may not need immediate separation surgery as long as they can grow in good health, doctors said Wednesday.

The girls, weighing 4 kilograms, have gone through a series of physical check-ups in Chongqing's Xinqiao Hospital, a medical institute affiliated with the People's Liberation Army that has successfully separated four pairs of conjoined twins to date.

Doctors say the twins show symptoms of lung infection, jaundice and other possible illnesses that cannot be confirmed until the girls are strong enough for X-ray check-ups.

The twin girls share a gall bladder, spleen, pelvis and reproductive system but have separate spines, esophagi, stomachs, kidneys, and respiratory systems. Though the conjoined girls have two hearts, physical tests show that one is in an abnormal shape.

Doctors say their priority is keeping the girls alive. The girls are staying in the hospital's Intensive Care Unit with 24-hour care.

The girls were born to a rural couple at a hospital in Suining, a city in Sichuan Province, on May 5 and were transferred on Monday to Xinqiao Hospital.












 Any local obstetrician, or birthing doctors, cooperating with an agency in an improper and unprofessional manner with reckless disregard for the safety of pregnant women and their babies for profit, should face punishment, said the Hong Kong government on Wednesday.

The improper deals include providing admission certificate to any non-local pregnant woman who has yet to undertake any antenatal checkup in Hong Kong, changing the expected date of delivery, and unnecessarily arranging early cesareans for the sake of bed availability, said Gabriel Leung, acting director for food and health department, while addressing the city council Wednesday.

Leung said non-local pregnant women should be checked and assessed by doctors in Hong Kong to see if they are suitable to give birth in Hong Kong, so as to ensure the safety of pregnant women and their fetus as well as to maintain the standard of high quality services.

Based on the number of bookings for deliveries already made with local hospitals, it is estimated that there will be a slight increase in the number of deliveries in Hong Kong this year in comparison with that of last year, said Leung.

Leung added that the Hospital Authority has already allocated additional resources and manpower to obstetric departments and neonatal intensive care units of public hospitals. "It is anticipated that we are able to cope with the service demand this year."











A total of 92 senior Chinese officials met in Beijing for a ministerial-level seminar about food safety management, as the country carries out its largest crackdown on food safety hazards to date.

The officials, including vice provincial governors in charge of food safety and senior officials from central authorities, were briefed about the "severe situation" of food safety and major tasks in the coming period.

They also shared experiences and explored better methods of administrating within the sector, said Wei Liqun, Executive Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Governance, at the seminar's opening ceremony last Thursday.

The seminar was co-organized by the Organization Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, the office of the food safety commission under the State Council, and the Chinese Academy of Governance. It is scheduled to end on Friday.

The officials used recent food safety scandals as case studies, hoping to find better ways to coordinate supervision among various government departments and formulate a more effective supervision mechanism.

They also reviewed loopholes in current laws and criteria on food safety supervision and provided suggestions.

A string of food safety scandals have caused widespread concern this year, and the central government has promised a "firm attitude, iron-handed measures and more efforts" in handling the problem.









Chinese authorities have banned several types of food additives as part of new national regulations on food safety issued on Friday.

The new regulations also stipulated that all additives should be marked clearly on food product labels.

The Ministry of Health (MOH) on Friday issued four national food safety regulations concerning food additives, food product labels, honey products and the limit of mycotoxins in food. Mycotoxins are metabolites of fungi that can adversely affect animal and human health.

The use of benzoyl peroxide, calcium peroxide and methanal as food additives has been banned under the new regulations, as these additives are no longer necessary for the production of food, according to Chen Rui, an MOH food safety official.

Chen said the new regulations also prohibit the use of food additives for the purpose of concealing quality defects.

The new regulations cover the usage of 2,314 types of food additives, processing aids, gum bases and food flavorings, Chen said.

The revised regulations for food product labels state that labels for all food products should clearly state the names and amounts of food additives being used. The regulations also recommend food manufacturers to print warnings on products that may contain allergens.

The MOH banned the use of benzoyl peroxide and calcium peroxide in flour processing earlier this year, stating that the country's improved processing techniques for wheat and flour had rendered the additives obsolete.












Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said late Tuesday that China firmly opposes remarks and actions against one-China principle.

There is only one China in the world and Taiwan is part of China's territory. "This is China's consistent and clear stance on the Taiwan issue, and is also a fact recognized by the international community including the United States," Jiang said in a statement.

"We firmly oppose remarks and actions of some Americans who ignore the fact while violating the one-China principle," Jiang added.

Jiang made the statement in response to a recent comment by Richard Bush, former chairman and managing director of the "American Institute in Taiwan."

Bush reportedly said at a seminar that the fact that the People's Republic of China governs the mainland could not defy the existence of "the Republic of China" since 1912.

According to media reports, Bush said if Beijing accepted it, the "two-China concept" raised by the United States decades ago could be applied to the relations across the Taiwan Strait.














Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Wednesday called for strengthened efforts to help college graduates find employment.

"Employment pressures for college graduates are great as the number of graduates is increasing rapidly," Wen said at a meeting of the State Council, or cabinet.

Wen noted that some students' employment expectations were unrealistic, and employment services could not always meet their demands.

"The task to improve the employment environment for college graduates is still arduous," he said, urging relevant departments to "make every effort" to help graduates find employment.














China's anti-corruption chief, He Guoqiang, on Wednesday called on relevant parties to step up their fight against corruption by drawing on experience from organizing the 2010 World Expo in Shanghai and the 2010 Asian Games in Guangzhou.

He, a member of the Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Political Bureau and head of the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, made the remarks at a meeting devoted to discussing anti-graft experience in organizing the events.

No major cases concerning embezzlement or other violations of the law in regards to the organization of the events have emerged during or since the events took place, He said.

Senior Chinese leaders, including President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao, have also asked relevant parties to examine the experience China has had in organizing these events and use it as a foundation for the creation of a long-term anti-corruption mechanism.

Intense and comprehensive supervision of the organization processes for these two events ensured that all work was done in an orderly and transparent manner, He Guoqiang said at the meeting.

Last year's Shanghai World Expo and Asian Games lasted for a great deal of time and involved many construction projects, enormous capital input and a large number of people, he said.

China'e experience in organizing these large-scale events should be used in other industries and areas, with new regulations and procedures created in order to boost the country's anti-corruption efforts, he said.













China's State Council, or Cabinet,acknowledged that getting jobs remains a tough challenge for many college graduates and efforts must be made to help them.

A State Council meeting on Wednesday, presided by Premier Wen Jiabao, agreed that supportive policies must be adopted to encourage graduates to work at the grass-roots level and less-developed areas, and to become self-employed.

"The task to promote employment rate of college graduates remains arduous because the total number of graduates is still very large, and some graduates' expectations for jobs do not match the demand of employers," said a statement of the meeting.

According to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security, China will have about 6.6 million college graduates in 2011.

The statement said efforts should be made to "expand employment channels and create more opportunities for graduates."

China's plan to develop more knowledge and technology-intensive enterprises should help create more job opportunities. Small and medium-sized enterprises that employ university graduates could enjoy preferential policies in obtaining loans and social security, the statement said.

It said graduates should also be encouraged to find jobs at the grass-roots level in both urban and rural areas as well as less-developed central and western regions.

"More jobs should be created in the fields of social management, public education, health and cultural sectors," it said.

College graduates' concerns over income, social welfare and other "practical issues" should be properly addressed, it said.

It said graduates should also be encouraged to start up their own businesses, and relevant training and services should be strengthened.

"Graduates who start up their own businesses can obtain loans worth up to 100,000 yuan (about 15,380 U.S. dollars) and get relevant training subsidies," it said.

Meanwhile, university graduates are encouraged to become trainees or interns, with employers or local government providing subsidies for them, it said, adding that research institutes should provide more jobs for graduates.

The statement also said graduates from poor families can receive subsidies for finding jobs.

Unemployed graduates should register so that they can obtain assistance from the government, the statement said.

The meeting also heard a report on the work related to the Chinese living overseas.

The statement said "overseas Chinese should be encouraged to make greater contribution to their mother country's development, the peaceful development of relations between the mainland and Taiwan, and the country's unification."

"More efforts must be made to promote Chinese language education and the Chinese culture among overseas Chinese," it said. 














Senior Chinese official He Guoqiang has called for greater efforts to develop new high-tech industries in order to accelerate the transformation of the country's economic development.

He, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made the remarks during an inspection in Shanghai which lasted from May 24 to 25.

He visited the Jiangnan Shipyard (Group) Co. during his inspection. In June 2008, the company was moved to Changxing Island from the bank of the Huangpu River to make room for the construction of the 2010 Shanghai Expo grounds.

The shipyard's relocation allowed the expo to be a success and created new development opportunities, He said. He said he hopes the shipyard can take hold of these opportunities and enhance its ability to self-innovate.

The shipyard should continue to strengthen its core competitiveness and make new breakthroughs in key technologies, He said. [ In recent years, Shanghai has intensified its efforts to push forward the development of high-tech industries. The city is focusing on developing 9 specific high-tech sectors, including clean energy and civil aviation manufacturing.

While visiting the Shanghai High and New Technology Industrialization Expo, He said enhancing innovative capacity is the key to changing the way China's economy operates.

Shanghai should make full use of its technological edge and talented labor pool to create more local brands and innovate in technologically advanced industries, He said.

He urged Shanghai to make more efforts to develop its strategic emerging industries and foster new engines for economic growth.




















About 1 million copies have been sold of a new book on the history of the Communist Party of China (CPC) since being published on Jan. 11, said a statement Thursday.

The sales are the highest among books on CPC history and are expected to further increase, said the statement from the Party History Research Center of the CPC Central Committee, which is in charge of writing the book.

The book, focusing on the 1949-1978 period, came 20 years after the first book, which documented the history from the birth of the CPC in 1921 to the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949.

The statement attributed the large distribution to the increasing desire among the public to know about CPC history, especially this year, which is the 90th anniversary of its founding.

The first book was reprinted at the same time and has sold about 766,000 copies, the statement said.













The Chinese government has moved to regulate gift cards to stop a loophole that may help corrupt officials escape accountability when taking bribes, according to a document issued by China's Cabinet, the State Council.

"The regulation on commercial gift cards aims to prevent money laundering, illegal cash withdrawal, tax evasion and bribery," said the document on the State Council's website.

In China, an unknown number of commercial gift cards are issued every year as a means of payment for various specified goods or services.

Although gift cards play a role in reducing the use of cash, which facilitates payment and stimulates consumption, gift cards lack supervision or risk control measures, violate financial disciplines, and can even be used for bribery, the document said.

"Such problems have severely disrupted taxation and financial management and encouraged corruption," the document said.

According to the regulation, issuers of gift cards must register customers' identities if they buy 10,000 yuan (1,500 U.S. dollars) or more in cards, and the cards must contain the names of the people who will use them.

Anonymous cards must have a value below 1,000 yuan, while cards bearing the names of their users should not exceed 5,000 yuan.

These measures could increase the obstacles to abusing the cards and that would help to prevent corruption, the official said.

Further, the regulation stresses that all officials are strictly prohibited from accepting any kind of gift cards in their official activities.

Officials receiving cards and failing to hand them over to their units will be considered to have received the face value of the cards in cash, it said.

The State Council ordered China's central bank, the People's Bank of China, and the Ministry of Commerce to launch a nationwide inspection on all gift cards in circulation by the end of the year.














China's national social science research fund will be "used more efficiently" in order to create a stronger and more effective research database, an official said on Thursday.

The fund, established in 1986 by the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, amounted to 1.746 billion yuan (about 269 million U.S. dollars) between 2006 and 2010, Wang Xiaohui, deputy head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, said at a recent press conference.

Wang said the fund is designed to support strategic research on the country's overall economic and social development. The results of this research are highly useful for the Party and the government in their decision-making processes, Wang said.

However, he warned that those involved in academic misconduct will "receive warnings or public criticism, and will not be allowed to apply for the fund for three years afterward," said Wang.

He added that over the past three years, 10 projects subsidized by the fund have been revoked due to misconduct. Wang also said that the completion of 1,111 projects was delayed due to poor research quality.

The national fund also provided money for 2,034 projects concerning the economic development of China's western regions, he said.

Wang, who is also a spokesman for the CPC Central Committee's Publicity Department, also briefed reporters on the country's plan for the development of its social science program over the 12th Five-year Plan period (2011-2015).

Although the CPC Central Committee's Publicity Department established its spokesperson system in February 2010, Thursday's press conference was the first to be held in the department's compound in downtown Beijing.

The department's previous press conferences were held in the State Council Information office.

Dozens of reporters attended Thursday's one-hour press conference, which was also broadcast live on the Internet.

While welcoming reporters to the compound, Wang said, "More press conferences will be held here in the future, and we will be more open towards the press in general."

In addition to the Publicity Department, 10 other CPC central departments have also established their own spokesperson systems, including the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection and the Taiwan Work Office.

While being introduced to local and international media in June last year, the spokespeople for all of the Party's central departments vowed to "enhance news reporting and boost transparency."











A senior Chinese political advisor has called for more efforts to integrate the development of China's "united front" work with the country's social management work.

"United front" is a term used by the Communist Party of China (CPC) to describe its policy of uniting political forces that represent a variety of interests and entities.

Du Qinglin, vice chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and head of the United Front Work Department of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, made the remarks during a three-day inspection tour, which ended Wednesday in northeast China's Liaoning Province.

United front work can strengthen governmental work that is being done at grassroots levels and coordinate diverse interests, Du said, adding that the development of China's united front work is in line with the goals of China's social management system.

Du stressed that efforts to improve and innovate in the area of social management should be focused on work being done at lower levels of government, and that united front workers should make greater contact with non-CPC members and industrial associations in order to make their voices heard.

He also urged the usage of modern technology to improve the way in which united front work is conducted.














A letter from Chinese President Hu Jintao to volunteers who are teaching in rural areas has sparked passionate discussion among the country's college students and faculty.

In a letter dated May 10, the president spoke highly of work done by 18 graduate students from Peking University, saying that their volunteer project is an effective way to help young students learn from practice.

Hu said he hopes the university will continue the practice and encourage more young students to volunteer in the future.

Chinese college students and teachers saw the President's letter as a sign of attention and expectation from China's leadership, and also as a sign of support for student volunteers who serve in China's underdeveloped western regions.

Feng Pengfei, a student from Zhengzhou University, said the letter from President Hu made him more determined to take part in a volunteer teaching program.

"I will try to deal with hardships and contribute to the development of the west, just as President Hu said in the letter," Feng said.

Qing Zheng, a student from Beijing Normal University who will be participating in a volunteer teaching project in Xinjiang, said "Many children in the west do not get a good education. As the new generation of college students, we have a responsibility to serve the country in the places where we are needed most."

Those who choose to serve in places where they are most needed should be praised as examples for others, said Zhang Jiaming, an official from the School of Information Engineering of the Wuhan University of Technology.

Zhang said the school will follow President Hu's instructions to facilitate the creation of more volunteer opportunities for its students.

Volunteerism can not only enhance college students' abilities, but also foster a sense of responsibility among them, said Jiang Yuxin, a Communist Youth League official from Shaanxi Normal University.

University students should carry forward a tradition of volunteerism and go to small towns and villages, bringing their talents to the places where they are truly needed, Jiang said.

Qian Xuhong, president of the East China University of Science and Technology, said the university will also follow President Hu's instructions and work hard to cultivate more volunteers.

In a notice to educational authorities and institutions across the country, the Ministry of Education reiterated the importance of educating through real-life experience and called for more efforts to improve students' volunteering habits.














 Chinese Vice Premier Hui Liangyu has called for intensified efforts by local government leaders, agricultural experts and farmers to ensure that China will reap another bumper harvest of grain this year.

Hui's call comes in the midst of the worst drought to hit the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in more than 60 years. These areas are key production areas for grain and other agricultural products.

The regions affected by the persistent drought should take all necessary measures to ensure a stable supply of water for production and people's daily life, Hui said during a two-day inspection tour in north China's Hebei Province. Hui's tour concluded on Thursday.

He encouraged farmers to improve the way their fields are managed in order to ensure a good harvest for the summer. He also called for preparations against disaster weather, intensifying early warning of drought and rains so as to reduce losses from disasters to the lowest level.

Hui also chaired a grain production meeting with provincial government officials during his tour.

Hui said harvesters and other agricultural machinery should be checked and repaired in advance. In addition, the local government should help farmers to optimize their farms by guaranteeing a supply of agricultural production materials, Hui said.

China's grain output rose 2.9 percent year-on-year in 2010 to reach 546.41 million metric tons, marking the seventh consecutive year of growth.
















 Chinese legislators are conducting inspections to ensure the interests and rights of the elderly are protected in accordance with the law.

Yan Junqi, vice chairwoman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), concluded her three-day inspection tour of Anhui Province on Friday.

Yan's tour is one of the seven visits of Chinese legislators to inspect the law enforcement situation in Shanghai and the six provinces of Anhui, Fujian, Shandong, Yunnan, Shaanxi and Xinjiang from May to July.

"To learn about the law enforcement situation for protecting rights and interests of aged people is at the top of the NPC agenda this year," said a NPC statement on Friday.

Yan's Anhui tour focused on how the insurance scheme is being implemented, the medical care system, aid for those with financial difficulties, as well as home-based and institution-sponsored care service for the elderly.

Her tour was also aimed at urging authorities to improve social security for the eldery.

"The aging of the Chinese population is one of the serious challenges for China," she said.

The country, with 178 million people aged over 60 -- about 13.26 percent of its population, only has about 2.66 million beds in nursing home, enough for about 1.5 percent of the senior population.

The ratio compares with an average in developed countries of 7 percent and in developing countries of 2 percent to 3 percent, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.













In the era of reform and opening-up, members of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have played various roles in helping rural development. In Guancang village of southwest Guizhou Province, Party members are making great contributions in the local micro-finance industry.

Su Shaojian owns a pig farm in Guancang village. He earned an annual profit of 400,000 yuan (61,635 dollars) in both 2009 and 2010. As many rural entrepreneurs who started from scratch, Su encountered financial difficulties at the beginning.

Su planned to build the farm in 2007. He went to a local credit cooperative to borrow money but was told that it was only possible for him to get a loan of 3,000 yuan. The credit cooperative explained that it knew little about Su, and his credit rating was quite low.

Su then went to the village's Party committee to seek help.

"At that time, seven Party members and I had a heated discussion, but we eventually decided to act as Su's guarantors," said Xie Zhi, who is presently the village head.

Xie said they fully realized the potential financial risks but thought helping a fellow villager make money was more important.

"More importantly, though, we all knew Su very well, and we trusted him," Xie recalled.

Xie added that Guancang village has 1,069 households and 87 Party members, and within the village, Party members are regarded as reliable and open minded.

With the seven Party members acting as guarantors, the local credit cooperative eventually provided Su a 120,000-yuan loan.

In addition, an agriculture technology station in the village also offered to help Su as he worked to build his farm, and the seven Party members regularly paid visits to ensure everything was going smoothly.

Su earned 170,000 yuan at the end of 2007. Although he experienced ups-and-downs in 2008 due to the global financial crisis, his business bounced back in 2009 and 2010.

Xie said they didn't expect to get any economic returns, but Su's success led other villagers to begin operating pig farms as well.

Xie has acted as a guarantor for seven villagers since 2007. An increasing number of Party members in the village also became guarantors to help fellow villagers develop rice and tobacco farms, as well as fish farms.

Thanks to the booming micro-financing, the village's per capita annual income has increased by 500 yuan from 2007 to 2010. And because no bad loans emerged, the credit cooperative honored Guancang village as a highly-credible village.

Chen Qiang, deputy head of the Organization Department of the Yuqing County Party committee, said Party members in Guancang village resolved the information asymmetry problem between common farmers and credit cooperatives.

"Credit cooperatives knew little about common farmers, but they always thought Party members were credible. Meanwhile, Party members knew very well their fellow villagers, so by acting as guarantors, the members contributed in boosting the local economy," Chen said.

Song Lin, secretary of Ao'xi township Party committee, said the rural economic development relied upon two elements--technology and capital. Party members brought capital to fellow villagers by activating local micro-financing.

Qin Gang, a professor with the Department of Marxism Theory of the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, said it is still common that when ordinary people encounter difficulties they turn to Party members or grassroots Party committees for guidance.

By the end of 2009, the CPC had a total of 77.995 million members, about 116 times of that in 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded.

The latest figures also show that by the end of 2008, the CPC had about 3.71 million grassroots committees, up by 3.5 million in 1949.

The latest census shows the rural population of China stands at 674 million, accounting for 50.32 percent of the mainland's total population of 1.34 billion.

Tracing the Party's 90-year history, rural areas have meant a lot to the CPC. The Party's revolution-era bases were scattered mostly among rural mountainous areas across China, accommodating and nurturing the Party and its armies during its 28-year struggle to take power. The ongoing reform and opening-up drive started from rural areas as well.

How to strengthen Party members' role in rural area? The Party committee of Hougoumen Village of Ansai county in Shaanxi Province had its own innovation.

The village's more than 30 Party members each made a promise to fellow villagers each year. The Party committee hung their written promises on the wall, so all the villagers could check if Party members had fulfilled their promises at the end of the year.

Party member Yang Fengguo, who is an expert of watermelon planting, made a promise earlier this year to teach several villagers the watermelon planting technology.

Party member Li Ming has worked in city's construction site for years and has been leading a construction brigade. He promised to bring several fellow villagers to cities to join his project.

Gao Defei, deputy secretary of Yanhe Township Party Committee, said that the promises made by the Party members were down-to-earth and feasible. It was not difficult for them to fulfill those promises.

Hanging those promises on the wall helped strengthen their sense of responsibility and made them play a more active role in promoting local economic and social development, Gao said.

As an increasing number of farmers, including rural Party members, go to cities hoping for fortune, a method of contacting and motivating migrant Party members to contribute in hometowns is becoming a problem.

Gao held that the "promise-making system" helped enhance the ties between migrant Party members and their fellow villagers, as well as the ties between migrant Party members and the Party committees.

As many Party members in rural areas are going to cities to seek jobs, an increasing number of university graduates are coming from cities to the countryside for work.

Currently about 200,000 university graduates are working in rural areas, and the number is expected to steadily grow in the foreseeable future. Many of them have been or will be Party members. They are invigorating the grassroots Party committees in rural areas.

Zhang Xiaocui has been working for the Party committee of Hougoumen Village since graduating from Shaanxi University of Science and Technology in 2009.

"I grew up in the rural areas and my parents were both township-level cadres, so I have deep affection for the countryside," Zhang said.

She even planned to continue her work in the countryside after fulfilling her first two-year term.

"There are numerous things to do in the village, such as helping to extend social security insurance, helping build garbage collection stations or organizing a waist drum dancing team. I don't have free weekends at all," she said.

"University graduates working in countryside deepen their affection for farmers and the rural areas. At the same time, they instill new strength in the rural Party committees," Qin said.

Gao Xinmin, a professor with the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, said that the ruling Party's current major task in rural areas is to improve farmers' living standards and push forward local economic and social development.

"As long as individual Party members and grassroots Party committees in rural areas can play an active role in the local economic and social development, the Party will get people's support, and its ruling will be consolidated," Gao Xinmin said. Enditem













In a small village tucked into the rugged mountains in east China's Jiangxi Province, every household has a board indicating a person's name, workplace and mobile phone number on the door.

"He is my go-to guy," said 58-year-old Liu Guoyou, a farmer in Shangduan Village, Huangbai Township in the city of Ruijin, referring to Zhong Chunlin, head of the municipal Bureau for Letters and Calls.

"I often forget things at my age. But I can always know Zhong's number since it is right there, atop my door. Whenever I encounter difficulty in life and don't know what to do, I call him," said Liu.

"Now half a year has passed, and he has already become family," Liu said.

Liu's attitude is not an isolated case. Actually, every government official in Ruijin has become the go-to guy for 20 households, said Chen Xiaochun, secretary of the Ruijin municipal committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).

Chen, himself, often replied as late as midnight with text messages to local farmers. "Besides the 20 households that I am responsible for, I also make my mobile phone number available to the public," said Chen.

"I take problems and difficulties that people mentioned in their texts seriously. For some problems, I solve them myself, and for others, I forward the issues to the department in charge," Chen said.

Ruijin is the birthplace of the Provisional Central Government of Chinese Soviet Republic in 1931, and it is also the starting point of the Long March, a famous military maneuver carried out by the Workers' and Peasants' Red Army from 1934 to 1935 led by the Communist Party of China to combat the Kuomintang regime.

Today, Ruijin is a popular tourist destination for both its natural scenery and its "Red" heritage.

Ballads depicting diligent, selfless CPC cadres is still popular today. It tells the story of CPC officials who went to work wearing a pair of straw sandals and bringing their own food, and even when they finished with their daily work, they carried a lantern to pay household visits to solve people's difficulties.

"The CPC was set up with the aim of serving the people. Today, it is important for us to use new tools, such as the Internet, cell phones and video chats, to hear the voices of the people and help them realize their aspirations," said Chen.

Great changes have taken place in the country since the founding of New China more than 60 years ago. For example, the country has come a long way to become the second largest economy in the world. The distribution system has changed from the "eating from the same pot" to "distribution based on one's work". However, it also faces problems like the uneven development between regions, yawning wealth gap, social services being lagged behind, as well as contradictions relating to labor and debt disputes.

The biggest challenge at present is that whether the CPC can strengthen its blood ties with the people, under the backdrop of fast social progress and great changes in the country, said Dai Yanjun with the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The 12th Five-Year Program, the national development blueprint for the years from 2011 to 2015, states that China will beef up the government's role in social management and providing social services and optimize the mechanism of safeguarding people's rights and interests to ensure the harmony and stability of society.

Progress has been made. In east China's metropolis Shanghai, subsidized delivery rooms are provided to migrant workers and the municipal government provides 200 yuan (31 U.S. dollars) in subsidies to the hospitals for each new mother.

As for the lingering "Hukou system", the household registration system that classifies people as "urban" or "rural" residents, Dongguan city government in south China's Guangdong Province provides new channels for people to be registered as a resident there as long as they meet certain criteria, such as having worked in Dongguan for a certain number of years and having paid their social security.

In the year 2010, as many as 10,000 migrant workers became Dongguan citizens.

In southwest China's Chongqing Municipality, public opinions have been incorporated into government officials' performance evaluations since 2008. The public opinion poll conducted by independent pollsters take up one-fifth of an official's performance results, said Li Mingqing, deputy head of the Organization Department of the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the CPC.












Senior Chinese leaders pledged to promote further development in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region while making the improvement of the residents' lives the first priority during the second National Work Conference on "pairing assistance" projects to support Xinjiang development in Beijing, which was held from Friday to Sunday.

Li Keqiang and Zhou Yongkang, who are members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, attended the conference.

The "pairing assistance" projects, first unveiled by the central government at a high-level conference in March 2010, involve 19 provinces and municipalities in support of the development of Xinjiang.

Government departments should make efforts to advance the construction of projects that can promote higher living standards, said Li, who is also vice premier.

Li also called for measures to promote equal access to basic public services in Xinjiang, and he said efforts should be made to foster the region's development capabilities.

Projects to build major infrastructure and promote industries in Xinjiang should be accelerated, and the region's advantages in resources and geography should be taken advantage of in its economic development, he said.

Li added that more favorable policies for the region's development are needed and called for further support in the economy, education, technology and human resources to make the assistance projects more efficient.

Based on what he has observed during his two trips to Xinjiang, Zhou Yongkang said inspiring changes are taking place in the region.

Practice has proven that the CPC Central Committee's decisions regarding the assistance to Xinjiang are correct, he said.

While championing the importance of improving people's welfare, Zhou said efforts would be made to improve people's living conditions, strengthen bilingual education and create more jobs.

Further, Zhou called ethnic unity a "life line" of Xinjiang and underlined the significance of more exchanges between residents in Xinjiang and those from the rest of the country.

Zhou also stressed the necessity of properly tackling conflicts and problems during Xinjiang's development, saying it was important to ensure that both rural and urban residents benefit from local development.

President Hu Jintao also issued instructions to the conference, voicing his appreciation for the achievements made during the past year and calling upon government departments to implement the central government's policies for Xinjiang's development.












State Councilor Liu Yandong called for more support for education in China's rural and impoverished areas on the eve of International Children's Day as the country strives to make education more accessible in those areas.

During a recent trip to China's western Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, Liu called for deepening reforms in education as well as improved quality in all levels of rural education.

She said it was important to guarantee the funds for nine-year compulsory education in rural areas, increase subsidies for poor students and provide more support for children left behind by their parents who are working in cities.

Liu called for efforts to build more boarding schools and improve distance-learning facilities in rural areas.

Further, the State Councilor emphasized the importance of training rural teachers and improving their standards of living.












The State Council, or China's cabinet, announced Monday the appointment of two high-level officials.

According to a cabinet statement, Zhang Shaonong was appointed as vice minister of land and resources, and Fu Jianhua was appointed as vice director of State Administration of Work Safety to replace Liang Jiakun who was removed from the post.











As the 90th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC) approaches, the International Communication Office of the CPC Central Committee announced Monday it will hold a series of press conferences for domestic and international media on the Party's history and development as part of the celebration.

The International Communication Office will also invite officials from departments and institutions, such as the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee, to the press conferences, according to a statement by the office on Monday.

The office also plans to invite journalists to Yan'an city in northwest Shaanxi Province to visit historic sites and discuss CPC training activities. Yan'an was the CPC headquarters and the center of the communist revolution from 1935 to 1948.

In addition, province-level Party organizations in Beijing, Heilongjiang, Shanghai, Chongqing, Fujian, Guangxi, Shaanxi and Xinjiang will also hold press conferences and organize news coverage trips as part of the CPC's 90th anniversary that will be observed on July 1.











The Communist Party of China (CPC) on Monday called for strengthening and innovation in social management so as to address prominent social problems and safeguard the rights of Chinese citizens and promote social fairness and justice.

"Improving and innovating in the area of social management is closely related to consolidating the ruling status of the Party, the country's long-term stability and people's livelihoods," said a statement released Monday after a meeting held by the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.

The Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee General Secretary Hu Jintao presided over the meeting.

According to the statement, China is now facing important strategic opportunities for development, and is a period with prominent social contradictions, making the task of social management "heavier and more arduous."

According to the statement, the country will focus on "solving obvious problems that impact social harmony" and ensure social order and justice.

The statement stressed improving management and services for the country's migrant population and people with "special needs," as well as non-public economic organizations and social groups.

In addition, the statement said that the government will draw experience from foreign countries' social management experience while pushing forward the development of a socialist social management system with Chinese characteristics.














China plans to expand a piloted pension program to 60 percent of its rural areas this year, an increase from the original target of 40 percent, Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Dejiang said Friday.

Zhang made the remarks during a visit to the cities of Yulin and Baoji in Shaanxi Province that lasted from Wednesday to Friday.

The new program has made progress, as its policies and measures have been redesigned to attract rural people and basic pensions have been doled out on time, Zhang said.

China launched a pilot pension program for its 800 million-strong rural population in August, 2009, as part of efforts to narrow the standard-of-living gap between rural and urban residents.

Any rural resident over the age of 16 who does not take part in the government's existing urban pension scheme is eligible to join the government-subsidized program.

Farmers over 60 will receive a monthly endowment of varying amounts set according to their area's standard income levels after paying a fee to join the program.

In the past only China's urban dwellers were covered by the national pension system and old folk in the countryside had to depend on their children to take care of them.

By the end of 2010, the pension program for rural residents has covered 24 percent of the country's counties.













 The funeral for Li Desheng, former member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and member of China's Central Military Commission, was held here Saturday.

The Communist Party of China (CPC) has stressed severe punishments on those who break election rules in the upcoming local leadership reshuffles as officials at various levels finish their five-year terms.

The Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee in a statement Sunday urged local authorities to rectify problems and stoutly investigate and deal with activities breaking election rules in the nationwide leadership reshuffles.

To ensure the transparency of local elections and leadership reshuffles, the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee and the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) have sent inspection teams to 14 provincial-level regions.

The inspection teams will supervise local elections by having face-to-face interviews, launching polls and inviting public submissions.

Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang has pledged to take heavy-handed measures following food safety violations.

Li, also head of the food safety commission under the State Council, or China's Cabinet, made the remarks Friday at the conclusion of a nine-day seminar on food safety, which was attended by chief officials at ministry and province levels.

Li urges adopting strict and harsh punishments for food safety violations in order to deter violations in the most effective manner.

"Offenders in the food safety area should receive their due consequences for the violations," Li said.

Li also urges improving the enterprise responsibility system in the food sector.

All food enterprises should be covered in a food safety credit system, and those that have seriously violated the law and regulations should be closed and prohibited from entering the food sector in the future, Li said.

He also called on government departments to intensify supervision and to leave no "blind spot" in the supervision.

"Cases of official's malpractice in the food safety area should be seriously investigated and punished," he said.

Moreover, Li called for better transparency in food safety information to respond to the public's concerns and deal with food safety emergencies in the timeliest manner.

"Over the past decades, China has managed to provide the people with sufficient food, and we must make efforts to provide them with safe food," Li said.

He also stressed that promoting food safety in China will help boost the domestic and international market of various Chinese products, as well as maintain social harmony.











Senior Chinese leader Li Changchun has encouraged the Chinese culture sector to explore the global market.

Li inspected a showcase of intangible cultural heritages (ICH) and heard a report about the ICH protection.

He called on local governments to strengthen the development of the market value of traditional handworks and ICH items in order to bring the fine Chinese culture to the people and the market.

Efforts should also be made to explore the global market for ICH items and other traditional Chinese cultural items, Li said.

When visiting a cultural expo in Shenzhen, the seventh China (Shenzhen) International Cultural Industries Fair, he called upon the organizer to build the expo into a platform for Chinese culture to be viewed internationally.

When visiting a local residential community, Li called on local government to focus their public cultural services at grassroots areas.

He also asked the local government to include reform in the cultural sector into its local development plan to promote the cultural sector's scientific development.

Moreover, Li inspected some high-tech enterprises and research institutions and urged making further efforts in research and development of more market-oriented products to better serve economic and social development.












Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao on Tuesday hailed the achievements of the country's international rescue team and urged them to make greater contributions in both domestic and overseas disaster relief missions.

"Giving priority to people's lives, the team has made great contributions to the country and won international acclaim by conducting arduous rescue and relief missions scientifically and bravely," Wen said in written instructions addressing a symposium on the 10th anniversary of the founding of the Chinese International Search and Rescue Team (CISAR).

Since its establishment in 2001, the CISAR has participated in nine international disaster rescue and relief operations to date.

In January 2010, a CISAR team was sent to Haiti, where they helped rescue and treated 6,500 people.

"Practice has proved that the team, with exquisite technology and a hardworking spirit, is one that can be trusted by the Party and the people," Wen said, urging the team to make greater contributions in future missions.

At Tuesday's meeting, Vice Premier Hui Liangyu said that the international rescue missions the team conducted showed China's friendliness toward the beneficiary countries and reflected the important role China played in the international humanitarian field.

Hui said the team also demonstrated China's undertaking in building a harmonious world and safeguarding world peace.

"After the earthquakes in Wenchuan and Yushu as well as the mudslide in Zhouqu, the team reacted quickly...and brought hope and courage to people in the disaster-hit areas," Hui said, adding that the team's efforts in these missions were "irreplaceable."

Hui called for strengthening the team in order to further boost its rescue and relief capabilities so as to reduce losses incurred from disasters as much as possible.

Hui said that the team set an example for the country to build up more emergency rescue and relief forces.

Following the 8.0-magnitude Wenchuan earthquake in southwestern Sichuan Province in 2008, the team expanded to 480 members and was outfitted with new equipment and engineering machinery.














 China has launched a free online database of a collection of theoretical works by leaders of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and documents issued by the country's central authorities.

According to a statement Xinhua received on Tuesday from the People's Publishing House, which operates the database, the database's website, www.ccpph.com.cn, aims to showcase the theoretical research achievements that the CPC has made since its founding 90 years ago.

Boasting more than 10,000 books saved as virtual files, the database highlights works by China's leaders of different periods including Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, as well as works on Marxism and Leninism, the statement said.

The building of the database, a government-funded project, began in 2008.















A massive crawler crane rolled off the production line of China's largest machine manufacturer, Sany Group, on Tuesday in east Jiangsu Province, marking a major step forward for the Chinese manufacturing industry.

The crawler crane SCC86000TM, developed by Sany in the city of Kunshan in Jiangsu, boasts a maximum lifting capacity of 3,600 tonnes and is believed to outpace any rival in the world in terms of lifting and torsion force, according to Sany.

The jumbo crawler crane will be mainly used in the construction of nuclear power projects in China, said Sany's president, Xiang Wenbo.

Before Sany entered the industry in 2006, China lacked a crawler crane with a capacity over 350 tonnes, Xiang said.

He noted that Sany succeeded in developing China's first crawler crane with a capacity over 400 tonnes in 2006, the country's first 1,000-tonne crawler crane in 2008, and 1,600-tonne crane in 2010.
















China's top legislature has received more than 230,000 public submissions on a draft amendment to increase the minimum threshold for personal income tax from 2,000 yuan (306 U.S. dollars) per month to 3,000 yuan.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) published the draft amendment to the Personal Income Tax (PIT) Law on its official website, www.npc.gov.cn, on April 25, calling for public submissions. Tuesday is the deadline for submissions.

Feedback submitted online broke the previous record set by the draft Labor Contract Law in 2006.

During a bimonthly session that concluded late April, the NPC Standing Committee examined the draft amendment to the PIT law for the first time.

The draft amendment, featuring a minimum tax threshold hike, is seen as one of the latest efforts to improve the living standards of the country's middle- and low-income earners and to achieve fairer income distribution.

Jin Dongsheng, deputy director of the Tax Science Institute of the State Administration of Taxation, said the 3,000-yuan threshold accords with the current residential consumption situation, which also considered the inflation factor.

However, Prof. Li Daokui of Tsinghua University suggested that different regions use different minimum tax thresholds, such as 5,000 yuan and 4,000 yuan in more prosperous areas.

But Liu Jianwen, president of China Fiscal and Tax Law Association, said the threshold should not be too high or else "the PIT's coverage would become too narrow to raise public awareness on tax payment," and the decline in tax revenue was "not conducive to increasing official spending on public services."

Statistics show that most countries' major source of tax revenue is high-income earners, but in China, 65 percent of tax revenue is provided by the wage-earning class.

Prof Liu Yi of Peking University's School of Economics said the Law amendments mainly target the wage-earning class' PIT and fail to cover the stock dividends and other unearned income often attributed to the wealthy.

"High-income people's "grey income" is hard to monitor and tax," said Liu, calling for strengthened taxation management for the rich.

The country currently uses a nine-bracket progressive rating system, which applies a minimum tax rate of 5 percent to those who earn between 2,000 to 2,500 yuan, and a maximum rate of 45 percent for those whose earnings exceed 102,000 yuan a month.

However, according to the draft, the minimum tax rate of 5 percent will be applied to those whose monthly salaries range from 3,000 to 4,500 yuan and the peak rate to those who make more than 82,000 a month.

More than 200 million of the country's working class will stand to benefit from lifting the minimum PIT threshold. If the personal income tax threshold is lifted, only about 12 percent of the working class will have to pay taxes, down from the current 28 percent, according to officials.













 China's northwestern Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region will recruit around 9,200 bilingual primary and middle school teachers this year to promote bilingual education, local education authorities said Tuesday.

Xinjiang will hire 11,502 primary and middle school teachers in 2011 in total, 80 percent of whom can speak both Mandarin and a language of an ethnic group, the region's education department said in a press release.

This is the largest such recruitment in six years for urban and rural schools in 83 counties, cities or districts in the autonomous region, it said.

In an education development plan unveiled last October, the regional government pledged to offer bilingual education in Mandarin as well as Uygur or other ethnic languages for all 2.6 million primary and middle school students of ethnic groups by 2020.

According to the plan, this will help ethnic group students gain a command of the national language upon graduation from high school and prepare them better for jobs or higher education.












 A museum in northwest China's Shaanxi Province plans to exhibit retrieved treasures that were stolen from the tomb of a Tang Dynasty (AD 618-907) queen and sold abroad.

Shaanxi History Museum will display the retrieved relics later this year, which include a stone coffin and five well-preserved murals.

"After the murals are repaired, we'll hold a public exhibition to showcase the ancient treasures and to celebrate their retrieval," said Cheng Xu, deputy head of the museum, who was involved in getting back the stolen pieces over the past six years.

The coffin and murals were taken from the tomb of Wu Huifei (699-737), a concubine of Xuanzong, the seventh emperor of the Tang Dynasty, and sold in the United States.

Police in Xi'an apprehended a gang of thieves, headed by Yang Bin, in 2006 as the gang was attempting to rob another Tang Dynasty tomb in the suburbs of Xi'an.

Yang received a suspended death sentence in 2007, and two key members of his gang were sentenced to life. Other members received prison terms from 11 to 15 years.

The 27-tonne stone coffin was returned to the Shaanxi museum last year and the five murals, measuring 1.2 meters long and between 80 and 90 cm wide, were retrieved earlier this year and transferred to the museum on May 12.

Two weeks ago, the Ministry of Public Security initiated an eight-month campaign in 17 provinces to combat the rampant theft, smuggling and illegal trade of cultural relics.

The move was announced days after several works of art on loan from a Hong Kong collector were stolen from the Palace Museum in Beijing's heavily-guarded Forbidden City.












The wreck of the Nan'ao 0ne is one of 200 underwater heritage sites in China. Despite its relatively late start, the field of underwater archaeology in China is making significant progress. But as Zhang Nini finds out, even with financial backing from the government, a lack of professional expertise is hampering advances.

Into the murky depths of the sea. China's archaeological teams are diving deep in search for past civilizations.

A group of twenty archaeologists are taking turns to plunge into the South China Sea, where they uncover troves of cultural artifacts from Nan'ao One, a Ming dynasty sunken vessel.

They are each equipped with a face mask which allows real time communication with the headquarters, underwater flashlights with a backup bulb; a knife to cut through fishnet trappings, a compass watch, and an underwater digital camera which relays back pictures of the mysterious sea. The high-profile salvage operation is provided with top notch technology, but according to team leader Cui Yong, the lack of talent has hampered its development.

Cui Yong, leader of Nan'ao One Archaeological Team, said, "The biggest problem is that we do not have enough underwater archaeologists. We are divided between several salvage projects. And each requires considerable time, money and personnel."

Archaeologists are making meticulous efforts to extract items from layers of silt. More than two thousand pieces have been retrieved this year. The porcelain wares were made in private kilns, and were on their way to Southeast Asia. The patterns of traditional wisdom embody an auspicious meaning.

Chen Huasha, a researcher from the Beijing Palace Museum, says underwater archaeology is not treasure hunting. It's a much more precise job aiming at reproducing a lost history.

Chen Huasha, National Committee of Cultural Relics, said, "Treasure hunters rob the items and are regardless of the damage they do to the ship. They are after a profit from these items. But archaeologists try their best to preserve every piece of history in the ship. They do their job little by little. So it's time consuming and costly."

According to preliminary surveys, China has more than 200 marine heritage sites, 70 of which are shipwrecks of great archaeological value. It is a rich cultural heritage lying in the deep, like exhibits in a giant underwater museum. And it's in dire need of thorough protection.

Illegal salvage is rampant in coastal provinces. The pillaging of underwater sites has become so common that sometimes archaeologists discover a site long after robbers have ransacked it.

Apart from personnel shortages, Professor Wu Chunming believes the implementation of existing laws regarding underwater heritage protection should be strengthened.

Prof. Wu Chunming, Dept. of History of Xiamen University, said, "China has a regulation over underwater heritage protection. But treasure hunting and the illegal sale of cultural relics is still a serious problem. For a systematic approach to underwater heritage protection, China has a long way to go."

But Wu's also confident. With sufficient material and monetary support from the government, China has made considerable headway in underwater archaeology in recent years. And he believes that the salvage of Nan'ao One will serve as an example for future projects underseas.










Obviously ahead of the curve, you can see a lot of nature in a painting by Chinese contemporary artist, Qi Baishi, that was created more than a half-century ago. It sold for the second-highest amount ever paid for a piece of art at auction in the Chinese mainland.

Now, let's look at the current auction market to see why the painting hit a peak at this time.

Qi Baishi's "Eagle Standing on Pine Tree with Four-character Couplet in Seal Script", was sold at 425-and-a-half million Yuan, or 65 million US dollars. Its previous owner is a Shanghai-based entrepreneur, who bought the painting from a private collector in San Francisco in 2005. He confessed that such a high price for his privately collected item is totally beyond his expectation.

China Guardian Auctions Company certainly believes the painting is worth every penny. Qi Baishi's "Eagle" was painted in 1946 at the veteran age of 86, and it is said to be his largest work.

According to one survey, China overtook the United States last year to become the most valuable art market in the world, accounting for 33 percent of total sales with a turnover of 3 billion US Dollars. The boom is partly driven by China's expanding economy, which has produced an increasingly large number of wealthy individuals willing to pay high prices for sought-after pieces of art.

Now, Qi Baishi has sold for nearly as much as many established household names such as Pablo Picasso and Andy Warhol. That fact suggests that works by top-class Chinese artists are seen to possess permanent artistic value and timelessness.










 A newly-published 100-volume collection of works on Buddhist medicine was unveiled Saturday at the Shaolin Temple, the shrine of Kong Fu in central China's Henan Province.

China Buddhist Medicine Collection, compiled in 101 volumes and 70 million characters, includes more than 3,000 documents on the theories and practices of Buddhist medicine.

The earliest of the works dates to the Han Dynasty (202 BC - 220 AD), while the latest was written during the Republic of China (1912 - 1949).

"We use medicines to cure people's physical illnesses and Buddhism to solve their mental problems; the combination of the two is aimed to restore the balance and harmony of man's body and spirit," said Shi Yongxin, abbot of Shaolin and one of the principal compilers.

To complete the collection, the Shaolin Temple also offered its manuscripts on medicines, some of which had not been revealed to the public before, said Shi.

The Shaolin Temple, usually deemed the birthplace of Kong Fu, is also renowned for its achievements in orthopedics and traumatology.













China's first law for the protection of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), including traditional oral literature, performing arts, craftsmanship, medicine and folk customs, will take effect on Wednesday.

Approved in February by the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), the law has been hailed by experts as a milestone for China's efforts to better preserve its traditions of historic, literary, artistic and scientific value.

According to the law, the State Council and provincial governments must create lists of representative intangible cultural heritage for national and local levels, respectively.

Governments at all levels will assist with intangible cultural heritage preservation efforts in ethnic minority areas, remote areas and poverty-stricken areas.

Aside from providing effective protection, the law also encourages the development of cultural products and services based on rational use of the representative ICH items.

The law also supports representative heirs in carrying forward intangible cultural heritage items and conducting follow-up personnel training.

Cultural authorities must provide necessary places and funds for representative heirs to pass on related skills and knowledge and encourage participation in non-profit social activities, according to the law.

The law also states that foreign organizations and individuals, before conducting surveys of ICH, will be required to first obtain approval from cultural authorities that are at least on the provincial level.

Also, foreign organizations and individuals must submit their research reports along with copies of on-site data and pictures during the survey.

Statistics show that China has 1,028 state-level ICH items and 1,488 state-level representative heirs. The country's total ICH resources amount to nearly 870,000 items.












Southwest China's Chongqing Municipality began constructing a museum on Monday for centuries-old rock carvings that were placed in the World Heritage List in 1999.

The planned Dazu Rock Carvings Museum in Chongqing's Dazu County covers 6.6 hectares and will cost 290 million yuan (about 44.4 million U.S. dollars), the county government said in a press release.

The museum will showcase China's Buddhism, rock carving, folk arts and heritage protection efforts, it said in a press release.

More than 50,000 individual rock carvings lie in the grottoes of Dazu County. The carvings date from the 9th to 13th centuries and were placed on the World Heritage List by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in 1999.

The museum will use digital and multimedia devices to better preserve and study these pieces.

Construction of the museum began on Monday to commemorate World Heritage Day.

Meanwhile, experts are restoring one of the site's best-known Buddhist statues. The sculpture of Qianshou Guanyin, the bodhisattva with a thousand hands associated with compassion as venerated by East Asian Buddhists, was carved about 800 years ago during the Southern Song Dynasty (1127 to 1279).

Guanyin, also known as "Goddess of Mercy," has 1,007 arms, with one eye carved in each palm.

Over the centuries, the statue's color has faded, some of the gold foil covering her has peeled off, cracks have appeared and in 2007, part of one of her many fingers fell off.













Mauritius is pushing for the Black River Gorges as a World Heritage Site (WHS) and has received UNESCO's nod to nominate it on the list.

This was announced by the minister of arts and culture Mookhesswur Choonee at the first official stamp issue for 2011, which included a first day cover with four new stamps and a miniature sheet to promote the cultural heritage of the island, according to the Independent daily on Tuesday.

"The government wants to make Mauritius a cultural destination and the dossier on the Black River Gorges is underway and it will be submitted in 2011 to the world heritage committee," the minister was quoted as saying.

If it meets all the criteria, the Black River Gorges will become the third WHS in the Indian Ocean island country. The two existing WHS are Aapravasi Ghat and Le Morne, which are "cultural sites" like the Ajanta caves in India, the Budhist ruins in Pakistan and the Robben Island in South Africa.

The Black River Gorges falls under the category of World Natural Heritage Site just like the Grand Canyon in the USA and the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.

The minister also revealed that Mauritius has been recognized by UNESCO as a reference concerning preservation and conservation of heritage sites at the Africa World Heritage Committee held in Dakar, Senegal from April 13-15.

At the meeting, UNESCO experts have not only recognized the Mauritian experience but have also decided to give financial and technical support to the Black River Gorges dossier.

The minister also announced that his ministry was working to register intangible cultural heritage such as the Mauritian "sega typique", Rodriguan "sega tambour", Bhojpuri folklore and traditions and "sega Illois".

"My ministry has made the request to the UNESCO to allow these sites to gain recognition. We are awaiting the decision of the UNESCO committee before moving forward," said the minister.

"Meanwhile, we have already started preliminary works," he added.















An archaeological salvage team has restarted to retreat cultural relics from the wreckage of an ancient merchant ship that sank near the coast of today's Guangdong Province some hundreds of years ago.

The team plans to complete the salvage of all the relics from "Nan'ao-1" in 75 days. The retrieval of the shipwreck is not included in this year's task, officials in charge of the salvage said.

A large number of porcelain dishwares with exquisite graphic paintings have been found in previous archaeological surveys conducted in the shipwreck. Thousands of them were retrieved from the wreck last year.

The "Nan'ao-1" was believed to be en route to Southeast Asia from Zhangzhou City in the southeastern Fujian Province before it sank in today's Sandianjin waters off Nan'ao County of Shantou City during the late Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).











Archaeologists and engineers are working to restore protective eaves and attics to the 15,000-year-old Yungang Buddhist Grottoes, a world heritage site in northern Shanxi Province, to slow down its weathering.

The restoration is to take two years and cost roughly 50 million yuan (7.69 million U.S. dollars), said Zhang Zhuo, head of Yungang Grottoes Research Institute. He said the grottoes are facing serious threat of erosion as most of the original protective eaves have been damaged over time.

Engineers will first work on six most-damaged grotto caves, where some of the grotto columns are likely to collapse, he said.

The Yungang Buddhist Grottoes in Datong City boast 51,000 Buddhist images in 53 caves stretching for one kilometer along a cliff. The carving of the grottoes started 1,500 years ago. It was listed as a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage site in 2001.











Beijing police said Friday that they have recovered six pieces of art that were stolen from the Palace Museum on Monday, and they will continue their search for the other missing pieces.

Police authorities, however, did not say how many pieces remain missing and how they recovered the lost relics that had been loaned to the Palace Museum by Hong Kong's private Liang Yi Museum.

Fu Zhenghua, director of the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, cited the museum's support and the police's application of "advanced technologies" as reasons for a fast recovery of the stolen pieces.

Police had previously detained a male suspect, 28, in a suburban Beijing Internet cafe. Shi Baikui, a native of east China's Shandong Province, is suspected of breaking into the heavily-guarded Forbidden City museum to steal the relics, mostly Western-style make-up cases encrusted with jewels, on May 9.

Shi confessed to the theft during police interrogations, officials said.












Two people who are suspected of stealing a collection of priceless books and other relics from the home of one of China's most revered scholars stood trial in Beijing on Wednesday.

Wang Ru, 48, and Fang Xianru, 58, are accused of breaking into Professor Ji Xianlin's former residence in Peking University in December of 2009 and stealing a collection valued at 3.33 million yuan (512,308 U.S. dollars), prosecutors told the Beijing No. 1 Intermediate Court.

Fang was Ji's former housekeeper, while Wang was identified as a foster daughter of Ji's former secretary, according to Ji Cheng, son of Ji Xianlin.

The stolen items, including 5,000 ancient books and rare bronze statues, have been recovered by the police.

The items were kept at the residence after the scholar, best known for his research on primeval Buddhist languages and Sanskritic literature, died at the age of 98 in 2009.

Ji was a well-known Chinese academic who was fluent in 12 different foreign languages. He served as a professor with the Oriental Studies department of Peking University from 1946 to 1983. He also served as deputy president of the university between 1978 and 1984.













A spokesman with the Beijing-based Palace Museum, located inside the world-famous Forbidden City, offered an apology to the Hong Kong-based Liang Yi Museum on Wednesday after several of the Hong Kong museum's relics were stolen from an exhibition at the Palace Museum.

Saying that there is a "heavy weight on my mind," Feng Nai'en, Spokesman and Curatorial Assistant with the Palace Museum, said at a news conference that "the Palace Museum bears an unshirkable responsibility for this regretful incident."

According to Feng, a museum staff member found and questioned a "suspicious" man in the museum at 10:30 p.m. Sunday night. The man fled when the worker called museum authorities to report the situation.

The museum then mobilized all available personnel, including armed police, to search the museum for the missing man, Feng said.

Feng revealed that several pieces of art were later found missing from a temporary exhibition. The items were on loan from the Hong Kong-based Liang Yi Museum and were discovered missing at 8:20 a.m. the next day.

Two of the missing pieces have been recovered so far, but are both slightly damaged, said Feng.

Seven items are still missing, according to police reports.

The missing items, as seen in pictures provided at the news conference, include small Western-style make-up cases encrusted with jewels.

Feng said the theft shows that some security facilities inside the museum might "have some problems," adding that the museum will adopt new security equipment and tighten relevant measures.

Feng said the museum has ordered all of its departments to thoroughly search all stockhouses, exhibition halls and security facilities for the missing items, as well as clues to their whereabouts.

Feng also claimed that the photos circulating on the Internet about the theft were not genuine.

At the same news conference, Wang Xiahong, a representative of the Liang Yi Museum, expressed "absolute trust" in the Palace Museum, and said the museum will continue its visiting exhibition in the Beijing-based museum as planned.












She was "shocked" when she was informed of the theft on Monday morning, Wang said, but "the incident was not foreseeable. It already happened, and I hope that the Palace Museum doesn't feel too guilty about it."

Wang didn't reveal the market values of the stolen items, saying that the market values cannot reflect the historical significance the art pieces bear.

Feng said that the Palace Museum will restore and arrange the temporary exhibition as soon as possible, and ensure the safety of the remaining pieces.

The exhibit is temporarily closed but expected to reopen soon.

Feng said that the incident has been reported to the State Administration of Cultural Heritage and the Ministry of Culture.

The Palace Museum last encountered a case of theft in 1991. That case was eventually solved.

On Tuesday, China's State Administration of Cultural Heritage issued an urgent circular ordering various cultural heritage departments at the provincial level to enhance the safety of relics.

"A lack of caution and negligence are the major causes of previous safety calamities. Cultural heritage administrative departments and museums at all levels should fully realize the importance of the safety of cultural relics and give the highest priority to their security," the circular said.

The circular urged upgrades of security equipment and measures as well as improvements in the safety consciousness of relevant staff members.

The circular also ordered various museums to launch safety checks and ensure that at least 10 percent of all staff members at a museum are security guards.

According to the circular, the administration and the Ministry of Public Security will jointly launch a special campaign to crack down on relic-related crimes this year in 17 provinces.












China's largest wine museum has opened to the pubic in east China's Qingdao City, attracting more than 5,000 visitors in less than two weeks.

Built in an old civil air defense project, the 8,800 square meter Qingdao Wine Museum introduced the process of grape planting, the history of wine brewing and world famous wineries. Cellars and more than 3,000 wine sets were displayed from March 26, when the museum was opened.

Visitors can taste wine from about 17 countries for free. They can also store the their wine in the museum's "wine bank", said Wang Qifan, the museum curator.

China is Asia's largest wine consumer. The annual consumption per capita in China is 1.1 kg, only one third of the world average.

The market will grow rapidly as the Chinese living standard is rising and more people became interested in drinking wine and its health benefits, Wang said.













Chinese archaeologists Friday began salvaging a ship off the coast of southern Guangdong Province believed to be a Ming Dynasty merchant vessel loaded with masses of antique porcelain.

The excavation team has been working to anchor the salvage ship, "Nantianshun", above the wreckage of a vessel at least 400 years old, dubbed "Nan'ao-1", in the Sandianjin waters off Nan'ao County, Shantou City.

More than 20 experts will recover the antiques on the "Nan'ao-1" by June and raise the ship wreckage by the end of the year, said Pu Gong, deputy director with the Guangdong Provincial Institute of Archaeology and Relics.

The salvage operations will go ahead as long as weather conditions permit, Pu said. The excavation was scheduled to begin on Sept. 26, 2009, but was postponed due to severe weather conditions, including typhoons and cold snaps.

Local fishermen found the wreck, estimated to be about 25 meters long and seven meters wide, in May 2007 buried in silt 27 meters underwater and about 5.6 nautical miles from Shantou City.

It is probably a Guangdong merchant vessel, since most of the porcelain found so far was produced by local workshops, said Cui Yong, an archaeologist with the institute.


Archaeologists said the ship may have been carrying 10,000 pieces of blue-and-white porcelain, mostly made during the reign of Emperor Wanli of the Ming Dynasty (1573-1620).

"It is a very interesting find because, under the rule of Emperor Wanli, China had imposed a ban on sea trade," Cui said. "The excavation of the ship will help us learn more about China's foreign trade at that time."

By the end of March 2010, the wreck site had been monitored by border police for more than 1,000 days, said Zhu Zhixiong, head of the border defense police station of Yun'ao Town in Nan'ao.

"Since May 2007, we have patrolled the area nearly 4,000 times and stopped about 93 suspicious boats," Zhu said.

The State Administration of Cultural Heritage approved the excavation plan in early 2009.

Guangdong was a major center for sea trade in ancient China.

In December 2007, archaeologists salvaged an 800-year-old merchant ship loaded with valuable trading goods off the coast of Yangjiang City, Guangdong, about 600 km from Shantou.

That ship has been kept in a glass pool at a local museum, the water there duplicating the conditions in which the wreck was found.
















China is stepping up work to preserve the oldest section of the Great Wall after months of investigation to determine its length and location, archaeologists said Saturday.

The Great Wall's oldest section was built between 770 B.C. to 476 B.C. in the ancient state of Qi, hence the section is often called the Great Wall of Qi.

After a seven-month investigation, the Great Wall of Qi was found to stretch 620 kilometers, from Jinan City, capital of east China's Shandong Province, to Qingdao, a coastal city of Shandong, said archaeologist Li Zhenguang, head of the investigation team.

The results laid the foundation for the preservation of the Great Wall of Qi, which had constantly been damaged by local residents, he added.

After identifying the exact length and location of the entire Great Wall, a system can be established to hold local governments to account for vandalism, Li said.

The investigation is part of a plan to better preserve the Great Wall by the State Administration of Cultural Heritage.

According to the plan, China's knowledge of the Great Wall is very limited and many parts of it need to be explored before a comprehensive database can be built to better preserve it.


















Three Chinese archeologists left Xi'an, capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province, Friday for the United States to help with the restoration of two Chinese Tang Dynasty (618 AD - 907 AD) relics housed at the University of Pennsylvania.

The university asked the Shaanxi-based Daming Palace Foundation, affiliated with the cultural relics bureau, to recruit experts to help with restoration of the relics,two horse sculpture reliefs, which were smuggled to America in 1914, said a foundation spokesman.

The relics were among six stone horse carvings discovered in the Mausoleum of Emperor Li Shimin (or Taizong of the Tang Dynasty) in Shaanxi. The other four are housed in the Museum of Ancient Steles in the capital of Shaanxi.

The spokesman said the three Chinese experts would give much needed advice on the restoration of the relics.

"The two horse reliefs over thousands of years have decayed and been damaged by humans. They were even once cut into several pieces by tomb robbers for transport," said Zhou Ping, one of the three experts.

She said it was no easy job to restore the relics.

The six horse reliefs once lined the corridor of the emperor's mausoleum. According to historical documents, the carvings were modeled on the emperor's favorite horses.

















Salvage work on a sunken merchant vessel is continuing at Nan'ao island off the coast of Guangdong Province in the South China Sea. More porcelain has been retrieved.

Operations were hindered Saturday due to poor weather conditions. Strong winds made excavation work off the coast of Shantou even more difficult.

But divers managed to plunge below the surface early Sunday morning.

The new batch of relics pulled from the ship were classified immediately. Most of the pieces are blue and white porcelain. Some are still in good condition.

Most of the salvage work needs to be done underwater, because the hull of the Ming dynasty vessel was severely damaged when it sank. Divers mapped out the perimeter, removed silt and extracted relics. The artifacts are then lifted to the surface in a metal cage.

Excavators found some export-oriented porcelain on Nan'ao One. Archeologists believe further studies on the items will reveal more secrets of the ancient maritime silk road on the South China Sea.













 The Beijing Spring Auction is underway at various locations across the Chinese capital. China is the third biggest global auction market, which has seen a spike in sales over recent years. The Beijing Spring Auction had ten national class relics which went under the hammer drawing attention from around the world.

The highly anticipated Song dynasty hand scroll, "Song Copy of Guo Zhongshu's Four Horsemen Hunting" was auctioned for 71 million yuan, or 10 million US dollars at the Guardian Auction, on Saturday afternoon.

That's almost a 20 million yuan increase from its starting price, which was 52 million yuan.

The Song dynasty painting depicting the hunting scenes of ethnic horsemen, is one of the ten national class relics under the hammer this season.

It holds the record price so far during the Guardian Spring Auction.

Sun Jie, Marketing Director of Guardian Auctions, said, "This price has attained our estimation. The piece had drawn much attention among collectors before the auction was held. It's a piece from Southern Song dynasty. Paintings from that era to put on an auction, has been very rare. In addition, it was a collection of Qing court. So it is quite a sought after piece."










The chief executive of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Donald Tsang said here on Thursday that the Hong Kong government is working with the Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF) Authority to review and enhance the MPF system.

Speaking at his Legislative Council question-and-answer session on Thursday, Tsang said the emergence of the system was the result of public opposition against the government's proposal to form an old age pension scheme.

In response to the recommendation of forming a universal retirement protection system, he said the idea shares some common elements with a pension scheme because all people will be entitled to it regardless of their payments, so the current generation would support the previous generation.

Noting the aging population will seriously affect the sustainability of a universal retirement protection system, he said the problem will result in a continuous drop in young people who can bear the living costs of retired people, and a continuous rise in protection system expenses.

"Instead of starting another social debate, it is more constructive to review and enhance our existing protection system, " Tsang said, "We will also continue to put effort into elderly welfare."













 Charitable donations from 67 centrally administered state-owned enterprises (SOEs) totaled 181 million yuan (27.83 million U.S. dollars) in the first quarter of 2011, official data showed on Friday.

The donations were mainly used for disaster-relief work, poverty reduction and public welfare, according to figures published on the official website of the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council (SASAC), China's SOE regulatory body,

PetroChina Co. Ltd., the country's largest oil producer, topped the list with 38.97 million yuan donated, the figures said. Four other SOEs also donated more than 10 million yuan, according to the SASAC.

Currently, China has 121 centrally administered state-owned enterprises with total assets worth nearly 24 trillion yuan. Charitable donations from 110 centrally administered SOEs totaled 4.199 billion yuan last year.











China's state-owned enterprises (SOEs) administered by the central government, or the central SOEs, posted a net profit increase of 18.2 percent year-on-year in the first four months.

The pace of increase was 4.2 percentage points lower compared with that in the first quarter.

The combined net profits of the 121 central SOEs totaled 290.69 billion yuan (44.72 billion U.S. dollars) during the January-April period, the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) said in a statement on its website Monday.

The administration did not give any explanation for the profit rise nor the lower growth rate.

The SASAC said revenues of the central SOEs rose 24.1 percent year-on-year to 6.08 trillion yuan from January to April.

The SOEs had 553.99 billion yuan payable in taxes and fees for the first four months, up 27.3 percent from the same period of last year, according to the statement.














China witnessed the worst power shortage in decades in 2004, but the country's leading power distributor said Monday that this year might prove worse.

Some 26 provincial regions under the management of State Grid Corp. of China would suffer combined power shortages of 30 million kilowatts this year, said Shuai Junqing, the company's executive vice president.

As least 10 provincial grids, covering regions such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and industrial provinces of Hebei, Jiangsu and Zhejiang, would be hit by power shortages, Shuai said.

Shuai attributed this year's power woes to various factors, including a shortage of thermal coal, insufficient power generating facilities in some areas and grid transmission problems. "All these issues cannot be solved in the short term," he said.

The company vowed to prioritize ensuring power supplies for residents, hospitals and schools as well as those facilities in the public interest to keep running, including ones relating to national security.

In 2004, China suffered the worst power shortage since the beginning of the 1990s, with power cuts or limits imposed in 27 out of its 31 provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.











 China posted surpluses under both the current account and capital and financial account in the first quarter, according to data released by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) on Tuesday.

The surplus under the current account, which measures China's foreign trade, reached 29.8 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter, down 18 percent from a year earlier, SAFE said on its website.

For the capital and financial account, China reported a surplus of 111.4 billion U.S. dollars, including 42.6 billion U.S. dollars of net inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI), according to the SAFE.

The surpluses under the current and capital and financial accounts raised China's international reserve assets by 141.2 billion U.S. dollars in the first quarter, of which 138 billion U.S. dollars was kept as foreign exchange reserves.

By the end of March, China's foreign exchange reserves hit 3.04 trillion U.S. dollars, up 24.4 percent year-on-year, according to figures from China's central bank.













China Southern, one of China's leading airlines, will receive its first 787 Dreamliner aircraft from the Boeing company in the fourth quarter of this year, Boeing chairman and CEO W. James McNerney said on Thursday in Beijing.

The aircraft will be the first of its kind to be used in the Chinese market, according to McNerney. McNerney did not give a specific timetable for the delivery of the aircraft, only saying that it would be delivered "on time."

The CEO also said that Air China, another major Chinese air carrier, will receive its first Boeing 777-300ER airplane in the middle of this year.

Boeing's 787 Dreamliner aircraft are designed to use 20 percent less fuel than other aircraft of similar size, according to a profile on Boeing's official website.

The aircraft can carry as many as 290 passengers on journeys of more than 15,000 kilometers, according to the profile.

The company's 777-model aircraft are also more fuel-efficient than other comparable aircraft, thanks to their improved wing design and lighter structure, according to the company's website.










The profits of China's industrial businesses rose 29.7 percent in the first four months year-on-year to 1.49 trillion yuan (229.11 billion U.S. dollars), the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) announced Friday.

The growth rate, however, was 2.3 percentage points lower than that in the first quarter, the NBS said in a statement on its website.

The NBS figures showed that combined revenues of the industrial firms rose 29.5 percent to 24.11 trillion yuan in the first four months from the previous year.

The report was based on a survey of industrial companies with annual sales exceeding 20 million yuan each, higher than the previous (before 2011) threshold of 5 million yuan.

Combined profits for state-owned and state-controlled companies increased 21.5 percent year-on-year to 502.9 billion yuan, while those of collective-owned companies jumped 32.9 percent to 22.3 billion yuan.

In the first four months, foreign-funded enterprises and those funded by investors from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan registered an annual profit hike of 18.1 percent, totaling 406.7 billion yuan, the NBS said.

Out of the 39 industries surveyed, 35 reported year-on-year profit growth in the January-April period, while three reported declines in profit growth.

The ferrous metal mining and smelting industry reported a 71.6-percent increase in profits, while the chemical fiber sector climbed 77.5 percent in the January-April period year-on-year.

China will auction 250,000 tonnes of sugar from state reserves on May 31, with the starting price set at 4,000 yuan (about 615 U.S. dollars) per tonne, the country's Ministry of Commerce announced Friday.

It will be the government's fifth auction of reserve sugar produced during the 2010-2011 crushing season, aiming to ensure market supply and stabilize prices.

In the previous four auctions, China sold 760,000 tonnes of reserve sugar.













 China's foreign exchange regulator announced Friday that it will simplify some procedures regarding the management of capital accounts in a bid to encourage trade and investment.

According to the new requirement, which becomes effective on June 1, companies will not need to register with the local foreign exchange authority for deferred payment under the trade credit registry regulation.

They will also not be required to register when they need to reverse the exchange for advance payment, according to the announcement posted on the website of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE).

Foreign exchange remittance back home following the selling of state-owned stakes in overseas-listed companies can be directly conducted at designated banks, the SAFE said.

Local foreign exchange bureaus are also granted the right to approve and set the quota regarding bill of exchange guarantees by some designated banks.

Further, the new regulation will raise the benchmark ratio from 30 percent to 50 percent for advance payment under trade credit arrangements.

The SAFE said the adjustment will help reduce companies' costs and improve efficiencies.
















China's Ministry of Railways said Sunday that the country's railways are expected to transport 23.1 million passengers during the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival holiday, up 11.4 percent year-on-year.

The daily average passenger flow is estimated to reach 5.78 million, according to the ministry.

To ease the transportation pressure, railway authorities will add a total of 118 pairs of trains nationawide between June 3 and 6.

The Dragon Boat Festival, also called Duanwu Festival, is traditionally celebrated on the fifth day of the fifth month on the Chinese lunar calendar. It commemorates famous ancient Chinese poet Qu Yuan. Chinese people eat and prepare Zong Zi, drink realgar wine, and race dragon boat for that day.

The festival falls on June 6 this year and the holiday runs from June 4 to 6.















China's top legislature has received more than 230,000 public submissions on a draft amendment to increase the minimum threshold for personal income tax from 2,000 yuan (306 U.S. dollars) per month to 3,000 yuan.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC) published the draft amendment to the Personal Income Tax (PIT) Law on its official website, www.npc.gov.cn, on April 25, calling for public submissions. Tuesday is the deadline for submissions.

Feedback submitted online broke the previous record set by the draft Labor Contract Law in 2006.

During a bimonthly session that concluded late April, the NPC Standing Committee examined the draft amendment to the PIT law for the first time.

The draft amendment, featuring a minimum tax threshold hike, is seen as one of the latest efforts to improve the living standards of the country's middle- and low-income earners and to achieve fairer income distribution.

Jin Dongsheng, deputy director of the Tax Science Institute of the State Administration of Taxation, said the 3,000-yuan threshold accords with the current residential consumption situation, which also considered the inflation factor.

However, Prof. Li Daokui of Tsinghua University suggested that different regions use different minimum tax thresholds, such as 5,000 yuan and 4,000 yuan in more prosperous areas.

But Liu Jianwen, president of China Fiscal and Tax Law Association, said the threshold should not be too high or else "the PIT's coverage would become too narrow to raise public awareness on tax payment," and the decline in tax revenue was "not conducive to increasing official spending on public services."

Statistics show that most countries' major source of tax revenue is high-income earners, but in China, 65 percent of tax revenue is provided by the wage-earning class.

Prof Liu Yi of Peking University's School of Economics said the Law amendments mainly target the wage-earning class' PIT and fail to cover the stock dividends and other unearned income often attributed to the wealthy.

"High-income people's "grey income" is hard to monitor and tax," said Liu, calling for strengthened taxation management for the rich.

The country currently uses a nine-bracket progressive rating system, which applies a minimum tax rate of 5 percent to those who earn between 2,000 to 2,500 yuan, and a maximum rate of 45 percent for those whose earnings exceed 102,000 yuan a month.

However, according to the draft, the minimum tax rate of 5 percent will be applied to those whose monthly salaries range from 3,000 to 4,500 yuan and the peak rate to those who make more than 82,000 a month.

More than 200 million of the country's working class will stand to benefit from lifting the minimum PIT threshold. If the personal income tax threshold is lifted, only about 12 percent of the working class will have to pay taxes, down from the current 28 percent, according to officials.









 About 1 million copies have been sold of a new book on the history of the Communist Party of China (CPC) since being published on Jan. 11, said a statement Thursday.

The sales are the highest among books on CPC history and are expected to further increase, said the statement from the Party History Research Center of the CPC Central Committee, which is in charge of writing the book.

The book, focusing on the 1949-1978 period, came 20 years after the first book, which documented the history from the birth of the CPC in 1921 to the founding of the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949.

The statement attributed the large distribution to the increasing desire among the public to know about CPC history, especially this year, which is the 90th anniversary of its founding.

The first book was reprinted at the same time and has sold about 766,000 copies, the statement said.











 In the era of reform and opening-up, members of the Communist Party of China (CPC) have played various roles in helping rural development. In Guancang village of southwest Guizhou Province, Party members are making great contributions in the local micro-finance industry.

Su Shaojian owns a pig farm in Guancang village. He earned an annual profit of 400,000 yuan (61,635 dollars) in both 2009 and 2010. As many rural entrepreneurs who started from scratch, Su encountered financial difficulties at the beginning.

Su planned to build the farm in 2007. He went to a local credit cooperative to borrow money but was told that it was only possible for him to get a loan of 3,000 yuan. The credit cooperative explained that it knew little about Su, and his credit rating was quite low.

Su then went to the village's Party committee to seek help.

"At that time, seven Party members and I had a heated discussion, but we eventually decided to act as Su's guarantors," said Xie Zhi, who is presently the village head.

Xie said they fully realized the potential financial risks but thought helping a fellow villager make money was more important.

"More importantly, though, we all knew Su very well, and we trusted him," Xie recalled.

Xie added that Guancang village has 1,069 households and 87 Party members, and within the village, Party members are regarded as reliable and open minded.

With the seven Party members acting as guarantors, the local credit cooperative eventually provided Su a 120,000-yuan loan.

In addition, an agriculture technology station in the village also offered to help Su as he worked to build his farm, and the seven Party members regularly paid visits to ensure everything was going smoothly.

Su earned 170,000 yuan at the end of 2007. Although he experienced ups-and-downs in 2008 due to the global financial crisis, his business bounced back in 2009 and 2010.

Xie said they didn't expect to get any economic returns, but Su's success led other villagers to begin operating pig farms as well.

Xie has acted as a guarantor for seven villagers since 2007. An increasing number of Party members in the village also became guarantors to help fellow villagers develop rice and tobacco farms, as well as fish farms.

Thanks to the booming micro-financing, the village's per capita annual income has increased by 500 yuan from 2007 to 2010. And because no bad loans emerged, the credit cooperative honored Guancang village as a highly-credible village.

Chen Qiang, deputy head of the Organization Department of the Yuqing County Party committee, said Party members in Guancang village resolved the information asymmetry problem between common farmers and credit cooperatives.

"Credit cooperatives knew little about common farmers, but they always thought Party members were credible. Meanwhile, Party members knew very well their fellow villagers, so by acting as guarantors, the members contributed in boosting the local economy," Chen said.

Song Lin, secretary of Ao'xi township Party committee, said the rural economic development relied upon two elements--technology and capital. Party members brought capital to fellow villagers by activating local micro-financing.

Qin Gang, a professor with the Department of Marxism Theory of the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, said it is still common that when ordinary people encounter difficulties they turn to Party members or grassroots Party committees for guidance.

By the end of 2009, the CPC had a total of 77.995 million members, about 116 times of that in 1949, when the People's Republic of China was founded.

The latest figures also show that by the end of 2008, the CPC had about 3.71 million grassroots committees, up by 3.5 million in 1949.

The latest census shows the rural population of China stands at 674 million, accounting for 50.32 percent of the mainland's total population of 1.34 billion.

Tracing the Party's 90-year history, rural areas have meant a lot to the CPC. The Party's revolution-era bases were scattered mostly among rural mountainous areas across China, accommodating and nurturing the Party and its armies during its 28-year struggle to take power. The ongoing reform and opening-up drive started from rural areas as well.

How to strengthen Party members' role in rural area? The Party committee of Hougoumen Village of Ansai county in Shaanxi Province had its own innovation.

The village's more than 30 Party members each made a promise to fellow villagers each year. The Party committee hung their written promises on the wall, so all the villagers could check if Party members had fulfilled their promises at the end of the year.

Party member Yang Fengguo, who is an expert of watermelon planting, made a promise earlier this year to teach several villagers the watermelon planting technology.

Party member Li Ming has worked in city's construction site for years and has been leading a construction brigade. He promised to bring several fellow villagers to cities to join his project.

Gao Defei, deputy secretary of Yanhe Township Party Committee, said that the promises made by the Party members were down-to-earth and feasible. It was not difficult for them to fulfill those promises.

Hanging those promises on the wall helped strengthen their sense of responsibility and made them play a more active role in promoting local economic and social development, Gao said.

As an increasing number of farmers, including rural Party members, go to cities hoping for fortune, a method of contacting and motivating migrant Party members to contribute in hometowns is becoming a problem.

Gao held that the "promise-making system" helped enhance the ties between migrant Party members and their fellow villagers, as well as the ties between migrant Party members and the Party committees.

As many Party members in rural areas are going to cities to seek jobs, an increasing number of university graduates are coming from cities to the countryside for work.

Currently about 200,000 university graduates are working in rural areas, and the number is expected to steadily grow in the foreseeable future. Many of them have been or will be Party members. They are invigorating the grassroots Party committees in rural areas.

Zhang Xiaocui has been working for the Party committee of Hougoumen Village since graduating from Shaanxi University of Science and Technology in 2009.

"I grew up in the rural areas and my parents were both township-level cadres, so I have deep affection for the countryside," Zhang said.

She even planned to continue her work in the countryside after fulfilling her first two-year term.

"There are numerous things to do in the village, such as helping to extend social security insurance, helping build garbage collection stations or organizing a waist drum dancing team. I don't have free weekends at all," she said.

"University graduates working in countryside deepen their affection for farmers and the rural areas. At the same time, they instill new strength in the rural Party committees," Qin said.

Gao Xinmin, a professor with the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, said that the ruling Party's current major task in rural areas is to improve farmers' living standards and push forward local economic and social development.

"As long as individual Party members and grassroots Party committees in rural areas can play an active role in the local economic and social development, the Party will get people's support, and its ruling will be consolidated," Gao Xinmin said. Enditem

As an increasing number of farmers, including rural Party members, go to cities hoping for fortune, a method of contacting and motivating migrant Party members to contribute in hometowns is becoming a problem.

Gao held that the "promise-making system" helped enhance the ties between migrant Party members and their fellow villagers, as well as the ties between migrant Party members and the Party committees.

As many Party members in rural areas are going to cities to seek jobs, an increasing number of university graduates are coming from cities to the countryside for work.

Currently about 200,000 university graduates are working in rural areas, and the number is expected to steadily grow in the foreseeable future. Many of them have been or will be Party members. They are invigorating the grassroots Party committees in rural areas.

Zhang Xiaocui has been working for the Party committee of Hougoumen Village since graduating from Shaanxi University of Science and Technology in 2009.

"I grew up in the rural areas and my parents were both township-level cadres, so I have deep affection for the countryside," Zhang said.

She even planned to continue her work in the countryside after fulfilling her first two-year term.

"There are numerous things to do in the village, such as helping to extend social security insurance, helping build garbage collection stations or organizing a waist drum dancing team. I don't have free weekends at all," she said.

"University graduates working in countryside deepen their affection for farmers and the rural areas. At the same time, they instill new strength in the rural Party committees," Qin said.

Gao Xinmin, a professor with the Party School of the CPC Central Committee, said that the ruling Party's current major task in rural areas is to improve farmers' living standards and push forward local economic and social development.

"As long as individual Party members and grassroots Party committees in rural areas can play an active role in the local economic and social development, the Party will get people's support, and its ruling will be consolidated," Gao Xinmin said. Enditem
