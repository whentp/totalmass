When it comes to at least two of the three Rs, it＊s clear that the nation ※could do better§. The latest Department of Education figures show that 16 per cent of seven year-olds are falling below the expected Level Two standard in reading, and 20 per cent are missing the same target in writing.
Plus, of course, each year the country＊s employers join in the refrain about the way in which school leavers are not only unable to mind their Ps and Qs, but have no idea whether to put their Is before Es, and when to deploy an apostrophe other than randomly when something sounds plural.
As to the reasons why this is happening: it could be poor parenting, lazy teaching, the growth of text speak, foul-mouthed celebrities, the victory of computer screen over printed page 每 take your pick. And it isn＊t only among the disadvantaged.
※There＊s an increasing number of children from better-off homes who are arriving at school without the advantage that reading brings,§ says Government education adviser Pie Corbett. An impression confirmed by Rosemary Clarke, director of the Book Trust＊s free-books-for-children programmes (Bookstart, Booktime, Booked Up), currently fighting proposed Government cuts.
※I see plenty of well-off homes with not a book in sight,§ she says. ※Loads of DVDs, TVs and PCs, but no books. Alternatively, I see shelves full of books that are never opened.§

Dr Rowan Williams: Time to fight for the write to be heard 15 Jan 2011
Dark days, then, for anyone who believes in the power of books. The good news is that, in recent weeks, powerful forces have begun to fight back against slapdashness and illiteracy. First over the top was the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, who earlier this month launched an essay competition for young people in the pages of this very section (www.archbishopofcanterbury.org).
Alongside him, now, emerges another bespectacled champion of children＊s writing in the form of Radio 2 DJ Chris Evans. In marked contrast to predecessor Terry Wogan＊s targeting of older listeners (his ※Togs§ 每 Terry＊s Old Gals or Geezers), this Monday Evans is launching a campaign on his breakfast show, designed to boost literacy among the country＊s 10- and 11-year-olds.
Having just brought out Memoirs of a Fruitcake, the second volume of his well-received autobiography (※Recounted with painstaking honesty and a generous dollop of humility,§ according to the Observer), Evans wants to encourage young people to acquire the tools of self-expression for themselves.
In a satisfying piece of symmetry, the fruits of the carrot-topped DJ＊s initiative will be on display at this year＊s Hay Fever, the region of the Telegraph-sponsored Hay Festival that is aimed specifically at younger readers and their parents.
Naturally, Weekend is heeding this call to arms, and joining the campaign to help children acquire the book habit early in life. Next week we unfurl our turbocharged, extended Telegraph Hay Festival Family Book Club; we shall be opening its pages not just to the eight-to-12-year-old age group, as before, but also to under-eights and young teens. It kicks off next Saturday, when we meet the award-winning author-illustrator Emily Gravett, and talk to her about her new book Wolf Won＊t Bite (for under-fives) and her classic story Little Mouse＊s Big Book Of Fears (for under-eights).
But while our Family Book Club is henceforth to have a new name, its regimental motto remains, as ever, Parentes Liberique Legant, which, roughly translated, means Let Parents and Children Read Together. The idea being that members of both generations work their way through each book of the month (as chosen by us), then get together at the end of that month to discuss it; perhaps with friends, but definitely with cake and biscuits.
A good idea? No question about it, say the country＊s top children＊s authors, who stress the importance of parental involvement in producing lifelong readers.
※The reason I＊m a writer now is because my mother used to read to me when I was aged between about three and five,§ says former children＊s laureate Michael Morpurgo. ※What she gave me was the joy of words.§
Best-selling author Jacqueline Wilson is in full agreement. ※Parents have an incredibly important part to play in shaping children＊s attitudes towards books,§ she says. ※What is lovely about this parent-child idea is that it includes fathers and sons as well as mothers and daughters.§
And writer Michelle Paver, creator of the successful Chronicles of Ancient Darkness series, says: ※I think the idea of parents and children reading together is marvellous. It＊s absolutely how I got started, from the moment my mother read me the Brothers Grimm. Listening to stories with your parents opens the door to all literature. It unlocks the secrets of books.§
And in so doing, opens up a special, private world to which the young reader will have lifelong access.
※Once you＊ve discovered reading, it becomes incredibly precious and personal,§ says Gaby Wood, the Telegraph＊s Head of Books. ※There＊s a Graham Greene essay in which he describes being on a train with his mother, and concentrating on one page with elaborate studiousness, so that she wouldn＊t know that he could read, and so that he could keep this glorious experience all to himself.§
However, there＊s much to be said for sharing the pleasure of the turning page with others. That＊s something the Mitchinson family, from Great Tew, in Oxfordshire, know all about.
The three Mitchinson boys, all dyed-in-the-wool bibliophiles, have been visiting the Hay Festival every year since they were born, and they＊re now nine (Rory), 11 (Hamish) and 13 (George). Mind you, their parents have Hay roots that go down even deeper; father John has been going there since 1993, and mother Rachel has been every year since the festival began, back in 1987.
※We hire the same cottage every year, as a result of which the boys now call it our Welsh house,§ says John, who co-writes the QI column for Weekend. ※It＊s not just the loveliness of the surroundings that keeps us coming back, either, it＊s the atmosphere. Very relaxed, very civilised, very child-friendly.§
Hay Fever events involve a lot more than children sitting mutely round the feet of their favourite writers. There＊s a vast range of workshops and shows for all ages, many featuring virtuoso performer-writers such as Steve Skidmore and Steve Barlow.
As well as being the joint authors of our January book choice Return To The Lost World (follow-up to Return To 20,000 Leagues Under The Sea), Skidmore and Barlow tour the country relentlessly with their stage show The Two Steves. The aim being to lure in reluctant readers through the medium of fun.
※What we do is part panto, part literary gameshow, part musical, and part educational experience,§ says Skidmore. ※We discovered early on that writing a book, and presenting it on stage, are two very different skills.§
An author who knows this only too well is Chris Bradford, author of the Young Samurai series (latest volume The Ring Of Water), who puts on a dramatic, full-costumed martial arts display in which he carries out the same elaborate Japanese combat rituals, and wields the same, gleaming-bladed samurai sword, that feature in his books.
※I＊m writing a new ninja show that I＊m hoping to launch this year,§ he says. ※There＊s no doubt that when children see an author brandishing a flashing blade, it plants in their minds the idea that a book can be an exciting thing.§
Messy, too. This year at Hay, performer-writer Charlie (Fast Show) Higson, author of teen-thriller zombie adventures The Enemy and The Dead, is booked for a horror head-to-head event with counterpart Darren Shan, whose 12-volume, blood-dripping Saga of Darren Shan series demonstrates the perennial appeal of vampires.
So strong a draw do the Hay Fever events have on their young readers, that crowd numbers quite often exceed those attending the grown-up side of the festival (adult speakers this year are set to include film star Rob Lowe, Nobel laureate VS Naipaul, Booker Prize winner Howard Jacobson, cerebral stand-up Dara O＊Briain and distinguished TV historian Simon Schama).
※More and more festivals are starting to twig that it＊s not the adult authors who pull in crowds of 1,000-plus, it＊s kids＊ writers like Philip Pullman or Jacqueline Wilson,§ says Steve Skidmore.
※I mean, you won＊t get grown-ups queuing for an hour just to get their favourite author＊s autograph, but kids will do it, no problem. They＊re your real fans!§
Which means that while writers on school visits often struggle to hold the attention of the noisy Year Fours at the back, they have a much less uphill task at literary festivals.
※When you＊re in front of a festival audience, you get the feeling everyone wants to take part,§ says Cathy Cassidy, author of the hugely popular Daizy Star and Chocolate Box Girls novels. ※And the level of questions you get asked is just fabulous. Sometimes they know more about your characters than you do!
※The times when Hay is at its best are when the sun is out, and all the flags are fluttering in the breeze. One year, I remember parking up at the camp site , looking round at all these hundreds of little tents, and this amazing mini-tipi, and thinking 'This is just like walking into one of my books＊.
※The thing I love the most, though, is being able to meet my readers face to face. A lot of them write to me on e-mail, so when they come up and say, 'You don＊t know me,＊ quite often I can reply 'Yes, I do, actually.＊
Keenness is one commodity that＊s not in short supply at Hay. Last year, for the first time, visitor numbers topped 200,000, and the Hay Fever side of things has gone from a bouncy castle in a side field to one of the biggest gatherings of children and children＊s writers in the world. What＊s more, the first two days are now devoted to educational events that are free of charge to school parties from the surrounding area.
※We＊re always being told that children today aren＊t reading, and are addicted to computer games,§ says Charlie Higson. ※Go to Hay, though, and you get sell-out audiences of children wanting nothing more than to hear their favourite authors.
※It puts me in mind not so much of a festival, as a pilgrimage. There may be a question mark about zombies, but books aren＊t dead yet, not by a long way.§※Everything I have ever written has been about the obvious,§ Germaine Greer announced earlier this week to a packed class of bilingual 14 to 16 year-olds in Cartagena, Colombia. ※For example,§ she went on, ※Why, in tennis, are the girls wearing skirts?§
The schoolchildren looked a little blank. Greer stared back at them and waited. Then she shrugged. ※If you look at Rafael Nadal, he＊d be better off wearing a skirt! Have you seen him? He＊s always doing this!§ She flicked her underpants in place, in an exaggerated impression of the player＊s famous gesture, and suddenly the whole well-behaved room was in stitches.
Earlier that morning, Greer, who was in Cartagena for the Telegraph-sponsored Hay Festival, had been unsure what she was going to speak about. The children, she＊d been told, were due to gather at the Colegio Brit角nico from several bilingual schools in this highly cultured city. They were the children of Colombia＊s elite. So Greer initially thought she might speak to them about poetry, and lighting on a topic designed to appeal to their international interests, she offered to discuss the relationship between the work of the late Mexican Nobel Laureate Octavio Paz and the American poet Elizabeth Bishop.
That was before she noticed all the boob jobs.
It doesn＊t take long for a visitor 每 well, some visitors, anyway 每 to see that Colombia is a country in which those who can afford it view silicone as a path to self-improvement. Well that, Greer decided, needed to be addressed. And so she scrapped all previous plans and embarked on a good, old-fashioned consciousness-raising exercise.

※Now then,§ she said in the classroom, clasping her hands together and switching to another topic, ※Why are girls doing so well in school?§
Half the class smiled, ready to be congratulated.
※Because someone is telling them what they want,§ came Greer＊s own reply. ※They don＊t think: ＆I want to do it a different way＊. My problem as a teacher is that my students work too hard.§ She explained the university exam system: three questions in three hours. ※That＊s one answer in one hour,§ she emphasized. ※How much can you write in an hour? Not that much.§ She held her hands out rhetorically. ※So how much do you really need to know?§
She went on to tell them how those exams were marked. ※At Cambridge University, where I teach,§ she said, ※you can get a First, a 2:1, a 2:2, or a Third§. This seemed like surplus information. But then she got to her main point: ※Who gets a First? A crazy genius gets a First. They＊re mostly boys, I have to say,§ she added, shaking her head. ※They＊re sociopaths. And show-offs. And they＊re unemployable by anyone other than another university. Girls get 2:1s. And they could have got those months before the exam. They come and see me when they＊re revising and I say: ＆Stop! Your wheels are spinning!＊.§
Greer paused and continued calmly: ※We get used to girls hurting themselves 每 burdening themselves. And this is before we even get on to what they look like.§
And here it was 每 her topic of concern. Greer switched into another gear. ※They＊re supposed to have long, skinny legs 每 which for women in this country is a challenge 每 and BIG TITS!§
The class giggled.
※That hardly ever happens in nature,§ Greer explained helpfully. ※Generally, bottoms and breasts come as a set. So you starve yourself, and then you say to your parents: ＆What I want for my birthday is＃＊. She made a large rounded gesture in front of her chest. ※And your parents might say: ＆Your nose isn＊t much good either. We＊ll pay for one operation＊.§
Things have changed, she told them. Some years after she wrote her groundbreaking book The Female Eunuch in 1970, she visited Colombia. At that time, there was still a certain kind of maternal, impressive woman who ran things. Now, she said, women in those positions are ※skinny, and have faces stretched so tight they can＊t close their eyes, and not a single hair on their bodies.§
She scanned the faces of the girls in the room. ※I＊m not going to embarrass you by asking how much time you spend removing unwanted hair, but it＊s time that would be better spent on something else!§
A girl put her hand up, and asked Greer for her opinion on Barbie. Greer, never one to be predictable, shook her head. ※I don＊t want to be too pious about Barbie,§ she replied, ※much as I fear the phenomenon.§ Her problem with the doll, she said, wasn＊t sexism so much as racism. ※Women in all parts of the world do not have hemispherical breasts,§ she stated. Yet surgeons now will tell you that if your breasts aren＊t like Barbie＊s they＊re deformed.
※I mean, Hitler didn＊t have to do a thing!§ Greer cried, ※They all came along and did it for him. Barbie is an Aryan princess.§
A woman at the back 每 a teacher, perhaps 每 put her hand up. She was striking looking: blonde, thin, smooth-skinned and heavily made up, with an unmistakably emphatic bosom. ※But so much is expected of women now,§ she said, ※we have to be so many things 每 smart, beautiful＃§
Greer adopted a look of deadpan despair. ※OK,§ she said with a sigh, ※it＊s time for the boys to say something. Because I think what women think men want is their own fantasy of what men want. What do you guys want from women?§
She picked on a meek teenager in the middle of the group. ※Do you want a trophy wife?§ she asked him.
※No,§ he said, quaking.
※Are you in love?§ she asked.
※Yes,§ he said, and the whole class smiled.
The boy quite reasonably said that his girlfriend liked wearing high-heeled shoes, and he kept telling her she didn＊t have to.
※So you think the shoes are her fetish?§ Greer asked. The boy nodded, perhaps never having heard the word before. She came to his aid with some background information. ※I call them fuck-me shoes,§ she said, ※because you can＊t walk in them but you can wear them in bed.§
※So how about you?§ she asked, moving on to the boy sitting next to him. ※What do you look for in a woman?§
※That she cares about me,§ the boy replied, ※That she worries about me＃§
Greer stopped him there. ※Are you sure you＊re not talking about your mother?§ she said.
After the class had recovered from its explosion of laughter (※you see, it would be interesting to analyse why they laughed so hard at that,§ Greer said later), Greer was asked what she thought of ※the idea of abortion§.
※Now look,§ she said, ※I know that for lots of young women the idea of abortion is unacceptable. For others it＊s tolerable. But it's not a privilege. You may think that because I＊m a feminist I＊m pro-abortion. That would be like being pro-amputation. I＊d rather not get gangrene in the first place.§ Most of all, she urged them to be thoughtful, and informed. ※Don＊t get drawn in to something that deep in your soul you don＊t accept,§ she concluded. ※Abortion is not an idea. It＊s a fact.§
Yes, Greer was outrageously funny. But the scene she created was also very moving. To witness, by surprise one Thursday morning, a vivid encounter between one of the world＊s leading feminists and the well-educated, still impressionable members of a mostly macho, Catholic country＊s future, was an extraordinary thing. Who knew what would become of them? But it seemed likely that, among dozens of children, at least one would find such exhortations unforgettable, and that, if nothing else, that life would be changed forever.great American composer, who will be 74 on Monday, tells us he rejects his "minimalism" tag, preferring to think of himself as a "theatre composer".
"The word (minimalism) was invented by a journalist, not a composer," said Glass. "My generation never thought of ourselves as minimalist. I call myself a theatre composer. I work in collaboration with others."
And collaborate he has, with, by his own reckoning, 40 film scores to his name. But he cautions: "The difficulty with film work is that it looks collaborative but really it isn't." Working with Martin Scorcese had its difficult moments: "He would scream at me... More than any other film maker he had a complete understanding of what he wanted. He knew all the camera angles before he'd shot the scenes."
Opera, by contrast, belongs to the composer. "I'm the initiator of the project. Once the team is organised, I let go," said Glass, whose ground-breaking opera Einstein on the Beach was composed more than 35 years ago.
He accepts the repetition in his music is a distinguishing trait that has won him a global following, unique among serious modern composers. He first discovered the beauty of repetition, he explains, in the music of Scarlatti and Schubert who remains his favourite composer.

But he also acknowledges an important debt to Indian music which transformed his thinking about structure. "Harmony and melody create the structure of western music, rhythm and melody create Indian music... (The new thinking) happened to me in one day but it took me ten years before I could play it in concert halls."
Glass has continued to play Koyaanisqatsi (which was turned into an award-winning film) every year since 1979 when he composed it. His recital tonight at the Teatro Heredia will include works that span 30 years or more, which he has performed hundreds of times.
Referring to the likes of Steve Reich and John Cage, he said: "All of us were performers. We took back for ourselves the metier of the interpreter. If we'd waited for interpreters, we'd probably still be waiting."
He suggests that for him, the creative process is largely one of selection, taking specifics from a general technique. So how does he go about creating his own "music of the spheres" - as Florence described it? "I don't really know where the music comes from. It puzzles me. Why did I choose to make Einstein sound like it did?"
To young composers, who he likened to craftsmen, he added: "By the time you're 30, you will have found your own voice. Before then master the technical ability so that when the time comes, you can write down what you hear."
Glass, who looks remarkably youthful, shows no sign of easing up - "I have a list of pieces I need to write." He also appears keen to revive Waiting for the Barbarians, a political opera adapted from a 1980 novel by J.M Coetzee. He revealed it had taken him 10 years to find a producer for it and because of its perceived anti-imperialist themes, was yet to be performed in a major US city. In Obama's America, maybe Glass will finally get his chance.Gabo's Magical Mystery Tour. Well, not exactly, but the culmination of three years' work by academics to launch the first official literary audio guide to the people and places of Cartagena de Indias immortalised in the novels of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the global bestselling author.
"All of my books have loose threads of Cartagena in them," Garcia Marquez once remarked, even though he spent a relatively short time there in his youth in the late 1940s. With the help and advice of his brother Jaime, the academics have managed to piece together some of the real-life locations that left their magical mark on the future Nobel laureate.
The tour begins, however, with a visit to Gabo's modernist "red house" overlooking the Caribbean Sea and the city's remarkable stone-and-coral walls. This is the house he had built by the time he'd become famous and, as the tour reveals, is a far cry from his near-starvation existence as a young writer. On to a cool, shady plaza dominated by a large white house, vines cascading from its balconies.
In reality, the house was owned by a Portuguese Jewish merchant who was unfairly condemned by the Inquisition. But it also serves as the fictional home of Fermina Daza and her nouveau riche father in Love in the Time of Cholera.
We pass the "twisted tower" of the convent of Santo Domingo which played a key part in Gabo's pursuit of "magical realism". The tower, it was said, was twisted by the Devil himself, and the myth made a deep impression on the political refugee who had only recently fled the turmoil of Bogota to find himself immersed in the diverse cultures of the Colombian port.

Across the old town we come to the El Universal building, the newspaper offices where Gabo started work as a local journalist. He would regularly sleep on gigantic rolls of paper kept at the front of the building, barely surviving on 32 cents an article. The offices are just a stone's throw from the Gabriel Garcia Marquez foundation which the author, by now internationally successful, dedicated to the development of Ibero-American journalism.
A particular highlight is the square where, close to a beautiful clock tower, Sierva Maria, a child rebel from a faded aristocratic family, is bitten by a rabid dog on her 12th birthday in Of Love and Other Demons. Beyond the city walls near the harbour, the statue Noli Me Tangere - Don't Touch Me - can be found. This is the spot where Gabo rowed with his father after he told him he did not want to be a lawyer but a writer. "You will eat paper!" his father angrily declared.
Our tour ends amid the giant palms of Bolivar park in the centre of the town, overlooked by the exquisite Palace of the Inquisition. Garcia Marquez observed that Cartagena was different from all the other Caribbean cities he had visited because of the "sinister watch" of the Inquisition.
The audio guide lets you take in the sights, sounds and smells in your own time and at your own pace - there is no tour guide to chivvy you along or over-burden you with detail. In our case, it was two hours well spent.Few newly-formed, Grammy award-winning bands can have had such clear intimations of mortality built into them as the Buena Vista Social Club. When world music producer Nick Gold and American guitarist Ry Cooder gathered disparate Cuban musicians together in Havana in 1996, most of them were almost 80, and one of the singers, Compay Segundo, had turned 90 by the time the album was released.
That, indeed, was a large part of the story that was eventually told by Wim Wenders in his documentary about the group that became an international phenomenon: on a beautiful, impoverished, politically cut-off island that Americans weren＊t even allowed to travel to directly, were ancient shoe-shiners and buskers who still remembered the secrets of latin music as they＊d played it in the 1950s. Ruben Gonzalez, for instance, hadn＊t owned a piano in 11 years, and claimed to be suffering from arthritis, yet after being offered access to a studio for a few days, he came up with an entire solo album.
They might have anticipated their deaths more readily than their success, which at the end of the Nineties was stratospheric. But the combination of success and death presents a bit of a problem, inevitably, for the band＊s remaining members. Gonzalez and Segundo both died in 2003. Ibrahim Ferrer, whose voice carried the group＊s most famous boleros, died two years later, and the bass player Cachaito Lopez died in 2009.
So when the band as it is now arrived in Cartagena de Indias, Colombia, to begin its 2011 world tour with an appearance at Hay Festival Cartagena - whose global media partner is the Telegraph - it seemed like a gentle joke that Buena Vista veteran Guajiro Mirabal＊s trumpet appeared to be held together with pink plastic clothes pegs.
But the exact quality of the music was less important than the effect it had on what trombonist Jesus Ramos referred to as ※Havana＊s sister city§. Vast numbers of people 每 three or four thousand at least 每 gathered in a huge colonial square in the centre of Cartagena, spilling far back, out into the warren of crumbling streets beyond and up into the balconies of every accessible building in sight.
The band, fronted by Carlos Manuel Calunga and accompanied by the thrillingly flexible movements of singer Idania Valdez, brought out their danzones and boleros and cha cha chas, songs not a single member of the audience could have been unfamiliar with: El Cuarto de Tula, Chan Chan, Toma Chocolate, Dos Gardenias. The collective exhilaration was extraordinary. And as an entire city got up to dance late into the night, it was clear that however few of Buena Vista＊s legends are left, the international relations they＊ve fostered are thriving.Comedians Sandi Toksvig and Sue Perkins will be among the attractions at this year's Telegraph Hay Festival - but their engaging new act will be showcased first at the Arts Theatre in London this Sunday (6th March).
Sunday Telegraph columnist Toksvig, and Perkins, appear regularly on radio together but will be trying out their innovative show Sandra and Susan Give a Lecture at the Arts Theatre, Great Newport St, London WC2. They will also be one of the comedy attractions at the 2011 Hay Festival, on Saturday 28th March, when they appear at the Barclays Wealth Pavillion.
Toksvig said: "Comedians Sue Perkins and Sandi Toksvig take to the stage to give an entirely improvised lecture on a subject decided on the night by the audience. Prepare to reveal the little you may know as Sue and Sandi try to find out what useful information (and possibly props) is in the room on the night in question. Banning all internet access, the show walks a tightrope through the collective conscience and tries to see what happens when an audience not a computer is ＆googled＊ live.
"Both Sue and I love the 'live' experience and want to see how far we can push it for a show."
Toksvig also loves the experience of performing to the crowds at Hay, which this year will also feature Paul Merton and Dara O'Briain. She added: "I have been taking part in the Hay Festival for years now and feel as though I am going home when I head there. If ever anyone was depressed about the standard of debate or the existence of cutting edge culture in the UK then a day trip to Hay will reassure them."Most of the small audience of Malayalees aren＊t familiar with the song, or indeed any of the back catalogue of tonight＊s star performer, Sir Bob Geldof . They just want more of his bassey rock 'n＊ roll. As the gig roars on in the balmy heat, there is a surprise: Sting, who joins his Band Aid buddy on stage for a catchy rendition of ※Hole to Fill§ . The crowd laps up the duet; if the modest amphitheatre in the Kanakakunnu Palace public park had a roof to raise, it would be spinning into the stratosphere.
It＊s a suitably starry end to the first ever Hay literary and arts festival staged in India and a memorable way for me to conclude my first visit to the southern state of Kerala. After a weekend of passionate debate and talks by such writers as Sebastian Faulks, Rosie Boycott, Simon Schama and Vikram Seth, I am a convert to the idea of combining an exotic holiday with a literature festival: poolside one day, brain gymnasium the next.
An hour after the Geldof concert I find myself at a beach party, 10 miles south, in the coconut-curtained town of Kovalam . A smiling waiter offers me a choice of crab or prawn curry and I sit back to listen to the pleasing combo of traditional Keralan music and the sounds of the Arabian Sea.

The moon illuminates the huge waves and Kerala＊s claim to be ※God＊s own country§ seems a pretty fair one. I am relieved; earlier in my trip through the communist-governed state of Kerala, I had began to think its tourism slogan was either pure chutzpah or misplaced irony.
Ten days earlier in Kochi, the biggest boat I have ever seen in my life slides past the manicured gardens of the Vivanta by Taj Malabar hotel at the tip of Willingdon Island , a tiny tugboat guiding it towards the new Vallarpadam container terminal. The terminal has long been needed.
Financed with Dubai dirhams in the heart of Kochi＊s outlet to the Arabian Sea, it means the world＊s most populous democracy will no longer have to receive its container ships via neighbouring Sri Lanka. Emblazoned on the boat＊s hull in 70ft-high white letters is the word ※INDIA§: an announcement to even the most short-sighted of observers that Kochi is back in business as a key trading centre.
※Perhaps the Indian economy can save the world after all,§ I suggest later, over Indian whisky in the hotel＊s reassuringly old-fashioned bar, to businessman Naveen Ravi. He recognises my eyes are still wide from the sight of the gigantic container ship. ※Yes, perhaps we can, but watching history unfold right in front of you can be daunting. If you prefer it at arm＊s length, you should take the ferry to the heritage centre of Fort Kochi.§
The next day I follow his advice, but sadly the 16th-century stronghold of Fort Kochi isn＊t quite the magical mix of colonial architecture and benign village-green atmosphere that Ravi, and most of the guidebooks, have promised. The original Portuguese walls of the fort were damaged as early as 1683 by the Dutch and then finished off by their British successors.
So, unlike the impressive Galle Fort in nearby Sri Lanka, there isn＊t a sense of architectural unity. But there are plenty of sights to take in: the ingeniously lazy Chinese fishing nets (plonk in net, wait, then lift out fish) and the historical buildings such as the pretty Jewish synagogue; the oldest European Christian church in India, housing the grave of Vasco da Gama ; a Jain temple; and the Mattancherry Palace.
All are interesting places 每 if you don＊t mind joining coachloads of domestic tourists and queues, dodging stray dogs and fending off persistent Kashmiri trinket salesmen. Admittedly, the anarchic traffic chaos is slightly less troublesome in Fort Kochi than is the India norm, but the litter-strewn local beach is far from desirable.
Not everything I encounter in Kochi is disappointing. The stylish Malabar House hotel and its sister loft space, Trinity , feel as if they have been beamed down from a friendly designer planet, and The Brunton Boatyard Hotel and its new David Hall gallery offer elegant colonial comforts.
But for a visitor in search of ※heavenly§ Kerala, there isn＊t much to keep you. Better to do as I did and leave the booming docks of Kochi and the internet caf谷s of the Fort and head to the genuine gem of the Backwaters.
"Sugar or salt lime soda, sir?§ asks Binoy, the friendly skipper of my new floating home, Spice Coast Number 4. I am sitting in one of those wonderfully comfortable Indian teak chairs with armrests as long as helicopter blades, watching stray water hyacinths and lavenders float by.
We are in the middle of Lake Vembanad , India＊s longest lake, at the heart of the 560-mile network of green creeks and wetlands that make up Kerala＊s Backwaters.
Freshly-made shrimp and coconut curry is announcing itself in warm wafts from the boat＊s galley kitchen. ※What is your spice level, sir?§ continues the captain. Life is pretty good if you are a passenger on my houseboat (locally known as a kettuvallam ). There are two other crew members, Sadasivan and Shadji, to look after me, and a mini pirates＊ wheel on the front deck to help Binoy steer us from one idyllic spot to the next.
The 70ft boat has been artfully converted to carry visitors rather than its traditional cargo of rice. It has a jackwood hull and a coconut-thatch roof held together with sisal that make it look, from a distance, like a giant knitted armadillo. I have a cosy cabin, with a whirling fan, to retire to; binoculars with which to monitor the rich birdlife; and, best of all, a detailed map of the Backwaters to study. The chart has symbols for toddy shops, temples, churches, mosques and synagogues, with a key that helps tell the unique story of this watery corner of the world.
Unlike the roads that surround it, the lake has its own well-ordered rhythm. Motorboats and kettuvallams have to moor by 5pm to allow the fishermen to set their nets in the brackish water. Peace prevails as the sun sets over the bottle-green surface of the lake and the only sounds I can hear are cries of terns and cormorants.
Bliss, until new noises of ritual teeth-cleaning and then heavy snoring start up from the crew＊s adjacent cabin. Lying awake under my mosquito net, I make a note that perhaps honeymooners should opt for a bigger boat or, better still, take day trips on the lake and spend their nights in one of the lakeside hotels.
The newest and best hotel on offer is a small property called Purity: an Italianate villa with designer-tropical grounds that ease down to a beach overlooking the widest stretch of Lake Vembanad. The interiors are a masterclass in elegant eclecticism, with Malabar＊s trademark vibrant colours played off against the occasional chandelier and a striking collection of contemporary and traditional Indian art.
As I step back aboard my houseboat from the hotel＊s jetty, I regret that I have had the chance only to visit and not to linger. Such boutique jewels as Purity are thin on the ground in Kerala and, like quiet bedrooms, they should be cherished.
A few days later, I am back on dry land, weaving through honking traffic on the back of the motorbike belonging to my new friend, Narvoze. As we head along the Thanneermukkom bridge to Vechur on the eastern side of the lake, he explains the problems of the boom in local ※homestays§: Kerala＊s version of b&bs. ※Great hardware, terrible software,§ he shouts. ※All that Gulf money has paid for new properties, but the owners are never there to run them properly.§
Thankfully, I am heading to a homestay that completely disproves his theory. Philipkutty＊s Farm has both charming hardware in the form of five pretty canalside bungalows and very hospitable software in the guise of its owners, Anu Mathew and her mother-in-law, Aniamma Philip.
One of the things you notice as you travel around Kerala is the confidence and independence of its local women. It is refreshing to see young women driving their own scooters, their bright saris rippling in the wind, and a relief to see middle-aged women on election posters (normally Communist Party of India), instead of the usual parade of stern-looking men with caterpillar moustaches.
Anu and Aniamma are part of this independent female tradition. Anu runs her 35-acre island farm growing coconut palms, cacao, mangoes and spices, and still manages to provide a level of service that would be the envy of most five-star resorts.
Aniamma is in charge of cooking and has the magic talent of combining flavours that make the taste buds dance. She specialises in Syrian Christian cuisine and delivers her heavenly food on a large lazy susan in the farm＊s garden pavilion: meen molee (fish curry 每 here, kingfish 每 cooked in coconut milk) , paddy-field prawns spiced with ginger and masala paste, pretty rice pancake dhosas, and a divine pudding of cinnamon rice, coconut milk and jaggery steamed in a banana leaf.
It is my last day at the farm and the sky is the colour of gunpowder as I watch Aniamma, Anu and her pretty daughter Anya being ferried over the canal in their small country canoe. They are on their way to six o＊clock mass at the local Catholic church and have dressed up in their best saris and shoes. Turquoise, cerise and orange, they stand out like Christmas decorations against the dark green of the tropical forest.
A few kettuvallams drift by, the sun goes down and the haunting sound of a 19th-century European hymn drifts across the water. I pack my things and put Anu＊s gift of home-grown cinnamon, mace, nutmeg and pepper at the top of my bag. Tomorrow I have a train to catch, the literature festival to attend and a few of Sir Bob Geldof＊s 20th-century European hymns to enjoy.※I love that John Connolly quote about how you couldn＊t set a crime novel in Ireland,＊ Val McDermid chuckles down the phone. It is the day of the general election in the Irish Republic, and I＊m interviewing McDermid, one of the UK＊s top crime writers, about the documentary she＊s made for Radio 4 exploring the profusion of crime fiction that＊s erupted from Ireland, north and south, recently.
The quote she＊s talking about is attributed in the programme to the bestselling Irish author John Connolly who, asked why he＊d set his long-running Charlie Parker series in the US, supposedly joked: ＆Because in Ireland everybody would＊ve known who done it within days.＊ It might be apocryphal, but it is a perceptive comment on why crime novels weren＊t a big feature of the pre-Celtic Tiger literary landscape in Ireland.
＆It＊s not like that any more,＊ McDermid says.
It certainly isn＊t. Irish crime fiction 每 ※Celtic Crime§, ※Hibernian Homicide§ or ※Emerald Noir§, as McDermid styles it 每 is one of the hottest tickets in publishing right now. In bookshops and libraries mobs of new Irish crime writers are crowding onto the shelves, jostling for space alongside offerings from Scandinavian, British and American authors.
Writers such as Tana French, whose Dublin-based psychological thrillers have topped the US fiction charts, and Stuart Neville whose soul-searing tale of a former terrorist haunted by his victims, The Twelve, has been swamped in critical acclaim. Writers such as the pioneering Ken Bruen and Colin Bateman, Declan Hughes, Gene Kerrigan, Declan Burke, Niamh O＊Connor, Brian McGilloway and, dare I say it, myself are attracting not just local but worldwide attention. The Irish economy may be on its knees, the political system in tatters, confidence at an all-time low. But in crime fiction at least Ireland has never been so vibrant.

Six of the best: Irish crime novels 08 Mar 2011
Ireland＊s boom and bust prompts rise in crime fiction 08 Mar 2011
So why Ireland, why now? Could it be because few places have been as fascinating, and puzzling, to its own citizens and the outside world as Ireland in recent years?
In Emerald Noir, McDermid argues that the crime novel is a ＆place where social change is identified and mapped out.＊ Nowhere, she says, supports this contention more than Ireland. ＆Ireland, north and south, has gone through seismic changes. That＊s given Irish writers a challenge of material. You really have got something to write about.＊
We do. The incredible economic boom of the Celtic Tiger years and the still more spectacular bust; the clerical abuse scandals that saw the Catholic Church＊s hold on the national conscience shattered; the Good Friday Agreement that rid Northern Ireland of terrorism for the first time in decades. The times brought new problems, too: gangsters, drugs wars, a rocketing murder rate and the ※crony capitalism§ that led to the devastating EU/IMF bail-out.
The world turned its eyes towards Ireland, and Irish writers 每 never a rare species 每 responded with stories as big and bold as the backdrop they played out against.
＆I＊m coming at it from the outside, looking in,＊ says McDermid, ＆and it seems to me that reading these books I＊m learning a lot about how Ireland functions these days. It feels authentic, as if I＊m understanding the way life is lived in contemporary Ireland.＊
When did she become aware of the Irish crime phenomenon?
＆I＊d known about Ken Bruen from the start, but Ken at that time was writing in a vacuum. It sort of crept up on me. I think it was when I started noticing writers like Declan Hughes and Tana French making an impact on my consciousness. Then, when I started looking, they seemed to be everywhere.
＆What＊s happened in Irish society has provoked people to write these stories, so I think the books would have been written anyway. The difference is that they have become much more noticeable because of what has happened politically.＊
It is something that McDermid can relate to from her own experience.
＆It＊s like what happened with the Scottish crime writing phenomenon. It＊s partly because you have a couple of writers who have success, like in the early days it was just me and Ian Rankin. Suddenly publishers wanted Scottish writers because they saw there was a market. Also, writers become alive to the possibilities.＊
That was certainly a factor for me. Despite being shortlisted for a Crime Writers＊ Association award for new writers, I was having trouble raising interest in the dark Suffolk-based crime novel for which I＊d been nominated. But whenever I mentioned my other novel, the Irish crime novel, publishers＊ ears pricked up. Encouraged, I returned to it with a newly confident voice. DI Mike Mulcahy was born, a man who, like me, had worked abroad for much of the boom, returning to an Ireland on the brink of bankruptcy, investigating a horrific crime in a country ill at ease with its Catholic heritage.
It wasn＊t long before The Priest found publishers here and internationally. That it nudged into the Top 10 in Ireland, briefly, was especially gratifying.
＆There＊s a sense in which publishers love to jump on bandwagons.＊ McDermid says. ＆Like after the success of Stieg Larsson they couldn＊t get enough Scandies. It takes a Stuart Neville or a Tana French to make a splash and suddenly everybody has to have their Irish writers. It＊s how the business works. And as a result, a lot of good Irish writers are being heard.＊Hay-on-Wye is a town (just as Wales is a country) that＊s blessed with many good things in close reach of each other. It＊s this simultaneous variety and proximity which makes a visit there so rewarding. Being able, for example, to browse the book shops (the newly renovated Richard Booth＊s Bookshop and cinema could swallow a day on its own), before taking a short stroll to the Warren, a meadow beside the Wye, to swim in the river. From there I like to float and swim downstream for the half mile or so into town, then walk back along the river path.
Walking into the Black Mountains can be done directly from the town. My favourite route is to head straight up the face of Hay Bluff then rest on the top to watch the gliders catching the current off the hill＊s sudden prow. Not far from here is the Bull＊s Head in Craswall, one of the best rural pubs in Britain, with great food, original Forties peeling wallpaper and local ciders.
Owen Sheers talks to the poet Don Paterson at 4pm on May 28 and to Francine Stock about the film version of his novel Resistance at 7pm on May 29.
Francine Stock
Market day in Hay is Thursday morning. With supplies from stalls, take a picnic to the Millennium stone circle on the Begwyns above Clyro; it＊s a decent walk, undulating rather than steep, with an uninterrupted panorama of the mountains. Later, you could get right inside that view up on Hay Bluff, but this side of the valley establishes where the town lies in the land.
Hay is bordered by, on one side, that block of mountain and on the other, the River Wye; by May, glide and paddle in a couple of hours down to town between the English and Welsh banks starting from Glasbury.
Back in town, sample the secret caf谷 in Booth＊s Bookshop and maybe Walter Jones Home Hardware shop, built in the old town wall. Then pause for reflection at Black Lion Green where preacher William Seward, an early follower of Wesley, was stoned to death in 1740. You could always give him a moment now in St Mary＊s graveyard at Cusop, on the edge of town.
Francine Stock will be in conversation with Andrew Ruhemann at 10pm on May 28, Roland Emmerich at 8pm on June 3 and Ralph Fiennes at 7pm on June 4.

This will put off the people who already dislike the idea of the Hay Festival, but what I really like about the event is the way it celebrates people striving to share great ideas. I find that genuinely inspiring when so much of the media seek to talk down to us and simplify arguments. At Hay, arguments are elevated and I love the elitism of it all. It＊s full of clever people being clever.
As for the place itself, well it＊s beautiful. If only they＊d move it two hours closer to London I＊d live there. I travel around the country a lot and see so many clone towns 每 and then I go to Hay with its individual character and it just works. When we get there, regardless of the weather, we head for the river, leap in and float downstream 每 until we realise just how far away we＊ve left our clothes.
I like taking the pin-in-the-programme approach to the festival. Open your programme at the day＊s events, stick a pin in the page and go to whichever event it spikes. Even if you disagree with the speaker, you always learn something.
Marcus Brigstocke will perform his comedy show The Early Edition at 2.30pm on May 31, June 1 and June 2, and at 1pm on June 3. At 2.30pm on June 4 he will talk about his forthcoming book The God Collar, which will be published by Bantam in June.

Most people haven＊t heard of the Black Mountains, and that sense of forgotten-ness is a big part of their charm. This is Border Country, and the place operates in a beguiling, low-level identity crisis: Welsh or English? Upland or lowland? The sing-song borderland brogue, part Welsh, part Hereford, part West Country, with its joyful ※Allooo!§, its ※tidy§s and ※bye now§s, is one enchanting side effect. Allegiances, obviously, are strictly Welsh, though almost no one speaks a word of it.
The mountains box above their weight. The Old Red Sandstone is the key. It has the consistency and durability of a Cadbury＊s Flake, giving the summits their characteristic ※table§ tops, and the farmhouses their sagging, mouldering charm.
Hay＊s setting is preposterously dramatic, the way the mountains tower above it, and I melt at the way the clouds lean on the tops of the hills, as if resting. But it＊s the combination of wildness with civilisation that＊s the thing: from a ridge walk in a gale, you can be in a pub nursing a pint of Butty Bach, in 20 minutes. There aren＊t many places you can do that.Poor Anthony Browne. Just three months left as Children＊s Laureate, and everyone＊s acting as if he＊s dead. ※It＊s true§ he says. ※Having a memoir and a retrospective of your work running almost simultaneously when you＊re still alive does feel a bit posthumous.§
We＊re in Foyles＊ caf谷 on a Friday night, drinking water and listening to Prince. Browne is small with speckled hair and a warm face he keeps low to the table but still, to his disbelief, he＊s getting recognised. I explain it＊s probably wise to be seen in public, you know, to dispel the rumours. He smiles, abashed. ※I＊m not exactly famous, am I? Especially following in Michael Rosen＊s footsteps.§ He has a point. Since its incarnation in 1999, the Children＊s Laureate has read like a who＊s who in Jackanory: Quentin Blake, Anne Fine, Jacquline Wilson. After Blake, Browne is the only other ※illustrator/writer§ in that order but now, as he hands over the baton, it seems now, at 64, he＊s finally getting national recognition.
A celebratory retrospective, Through the Magic Mirror: The World of Anthony Browne, opens at the Seven Stories gallery in Newcastle on April 9. It displays his most significant work from the last 35 years realised in various, interactive mediums. These include shifting landscape from 1999＊s Voices in the Park, images from one of his most commercially successful character series, Willy the Wimp, which tackles sophisticated themes of bullying and gangs and an interactive woodland from 2005＊s Into the Forest. The comparatively less cheerful memoir, Playing the Shape Game, is already out and explains the source of the gorillas which first appeared in his breakthrough work, Gorilla in 1983 but have been a recurring theme throughout subsequent books.
※Here＊s your scoop 每 they＊re all my father! You see, my dad was a boxer so he had this fierce, physical presence. Of all the animals gorillas seemed to work best. They＊re also fun to draw.§
Browne＊s father fought in World War Two before leaving the army to run a pub above which they all lived. It was a happy time and most evenings Browne, as a child, would take to the bar and regale the drinkers with the adventures of Big Dumb Tackle, his superhero alter ego. One day he and his mother came home to find Browne＊s dad wrestling the hoover thinking it was a Nazi. Another time he was fixing a plug and then collapsed, shaking on the floor. It turned out that he was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder ※although no one knew it existed then.§ When Browne was 17, his father died in front of him.

Aside from the Gorilla series, this father figure crops up regularly: in his eerily gloomy version of Hansel and Gretel where the father plays cuckold to the wicked stepmother and in Piggybook where he＊s just plain horrid; it was only upon finding his father＊s old belongings in a suitcase that he was able to write the buoyant My Dad. It was, he admits, also in semi-response to readers＊ queries: ※They＊d ask why I give dads such a hard time and it didn＊t occur to me I had. But of course, in retrospect, it appears I did.§
Naturally Browne＊s father is at the crux of the memoir. It was hard to write (※I felt pretentious§) so it was suggested someone ghost it ※as if I was a footballer§, but in the end he employed his son, and the resulting transcript came from conversations recorded in the car between the two of them.
Browne has an electric way with words but says his first love has always been drawing. ※Pictures are as evocative to me as smells.§ After graduating from art school, he started his career as a medical illustrator.
※That job was about accuracy, but there was room for creativity. Each painting had to tell the story of the operation, which was hard because there was so much blood.§
He went on to write and illustrate 40 odd children＊s＊ books, most of which featured animals in titular roles: ※I don＊t think children react better to animals, it＊s more that the characters happen to be animals.§ Either way, anthropomorphism is the chassis of his work. His bears pose, hands in trouser pockets, hunched over in that familiar forced awkward way we all do in family portraits, lines gently blurred.
He also likes to retell familiar tales, such as Goldilocks, in a modern fashion, and through these alternative social commentaries he＊s carved out an impressive niche in children＊s literature, giving his illustrations multiple, ambiguous meanings.
This goes some way to explaining why he made Goldilocks an impoverished girl from a housing estate and the bears, an obnoxious middle-class family: ※I always thought the story was unfair on Goldilocks. She＊s a lost soul not a villain.§
Realism, he says is satisfying, although it encourages critics. Some people think the stories are too real for children. Other ※small minded, horrid folk§ project their own racial prejudice onto his chimpanzee protagonists. He bats his hand as if to pooh pooh these people: ※I never want to make a child worried or afraid and I don＊t think I do. My pictures are born from the belief that children are far more capable and aware of social complexities than we give them credit for.§Staff have until midnight tonight to decide whether to move to Breakfast＊s new offices in the north-west, but BBC sources indicate that as few as one in five is prepared to make the move.
It throws the move further into crisis, after reports earlier this week that two of the show＊s presenters, Sian Williams and Chris Hollins, would not be moving north.
In common with many of the BBC executives who are leading the corporation＊s move to MediaCity at Salford Quays, Williams, 46, has concerns about uprooting her four children from their north London home.
According to one BBC insider, family considerations are also weighing heavily on many of the programme＊s 100 staff.
※I only know one person who is going,§ said the insider. ※A lot of the staff are married women whose husbands have better jobs, so they＊re all staying in London.§
Another BBC source said: ※There are a lot of unhappy Breakfast staff looking for jobs elsewhere in the BBC, or taking redundancy. And on Breakfast＊s ＆day one＊ in Salford, there will suddenly be a lot of inexperienced and new people working there.§
While BBC management privately stress that many staff have still not made their minds up, and that the final figure will not be known until the end of the week, one well-placed source estimated that only 20 to 30 per cent of the Breakfast team would move to Salford.
Williams＊s agent, Alex Armitage, said: ※This is not about going to Salford, but about a decade of getting up before the dawn chorus. We＊ve been talking to the BBC for the past six to nine months about potential new roles where she doesn＊t need to use her alarm clock quite so frequently.§
He added that Williams had not taken a final decision about the move.
BBC bosses are taking comfort in the fact that Williams＊s main co-presenter, Bill Turnbull, 54, has said that he will move to Salford. However even Turnbull has expressed doubts about the ※very big question of getting bottoms on the sofa§, with the programme＊s managers fearing that London-based politicians and celebrities will refuse to travel all the way to Manchester just for an early-morning appearance on BBC Breakfast.
The programme＊s bosses also worry that it risks losing its supremacy over ITV1＊s unpopular Daybreak, hosted by Adrian Chiles and Christine Bleakley, which often attracts less than half the number of viewers that tune in to BBC Breakfast.
The show is broadcast on BBC One, from 6am to 9.15am on weekdays, with an extended edition until 10am on Saturdays.
Susannah Reid, 39, who regularly presents Breakfast at weekends, has been tipped as the likely successor to Williams.

Critics have pointed out the enormous cost of the new state-of-the-art facilities, at over ㏒800million, as well as the reluctance of BBC chiefs including the head of BBC North, Peter Salmon, to move their families to Manchester.News that The Professionals, the hit TV series of the Seventies and Eighties, is to be turned into a feature film hardly comes as a surprise. It was only a matter of time before somebody, somewhere in a studio brainstorming meeting remembered the dodgy barnets, the laddish repartee, the punch-ups and the squealing-wheels car chases.
That doesn＊t mean it＊s a good idea.
Filmmakers are increasingly risk-averse these days, which is why we are getting so many remakes as well as films inspired by telly programmes from way back. Tried-and-tested ideas have an irresistible appeal in times of austerity.
And the results aren＊t necessarily regrettable. The recent Coen brothers＊ remake of the 1969 western True Grit, with Jeff Bridges reprising John Wayne＊s role, is terrific and at least as good as the original. (The fact that it picked up none of the 10 Oscars for which it was nominated last month is a great injustice.)
On the other hand, last year＊s big-screen reboot of the Eighties TV action series The A Team was teeth-grindingly dull and witless.
The Professionals, in which Lewis Collins and Martin Shaw swaggered around all narrow-eyed and macho as Bodie and Doyle, agents of the (made up) government department CI5, with Gordon Jackson as their abrasive boss, was originally broadcast between 1977 and 1983.
And therein lies the problem: it is a show very much of its time. Assuming the remake is an update, the period detail will be lost. Plus, without Collins and Shaw in the starring roles, what remains of the original concept?
I fear we＊ll be left wondering: what＊s the point? Just as we have been after so many risible TV transplants to the big screen.
Remember The Avengers (with Ralph Fiennes and Uma Thurman as Steed and Mrs Peel)? The Dukes of Hazzard? Enough already.It's hard to imagine anyone other than Sorell Booke playing Jefferson Davis "Boss" Hogg- keeping those dozy dimwit Duke boys in line. I suppose Kenneth Branagh could have attempted the part- but wisely shied off. Then there's Ralph Fiennes- he could have used his Schindler's List persona but Burt Reynolds was way out of his depth playing such a complex and multi-faceted character. He should have stuck to playing The Bandit where the car was the star- unlike in the Dukes of Hazzard where Boss Hogg ruled the roost. Leave the classics alone- don't meddle with perfection- it took consummate skill to craft such TV trash for early Saturday evening viewing- a slot that has remained vacant for over two decades now- awaiting a worthy successor to win the laurels.The next installment will be broadcast in March 2012, months later than fans had hoped the show would be on their screens.
The AMC network, which has aired the award-winning drama set in the decadent world of New York's 1960s advertising industry, each summer for four years, confirmed it had ordered the fifth season from Lionsgate, the company that produces the series.
But it said filming would be delayed "due to ongoing, key non-cast negotiations," according to an AMC statement.
"AMC has officially authorised production of season five of Mad Men, triggering our option with [producer] Lionsgate," the US cable channel said. "While we are getting a later start than in years past due to ongoing, key non-cast negotiations, Mad Men will be back for a fifth series in early 2012.
The network has been in difficult negotiations with Matt Weiner, who writes and produces the series. He has reportedly been angered by AMC's demand for each 45-minute episode to be cut back in order for more advertising to be fit in, and for two cast members to be dumped to cut costs.The 25-year-old musician described her ordeal in the final episode of Channel 4's Lily Allen: From Riches To Rags which follows Allen and her sister Sarah Owen as they launch their own clothes shop, Lucy In Disguise.
"I got really ill after he died and I was admitted into hospital and it was really quite touch and go for a few days," she said.
"It was amazing how my friends reacted so much more to me being ill than to actually what I felt was the devastating part. I couldn't have cared less if I was on my death bed.
"I didn't even feel it," she added tearfully.
The show was filmed before the songstress suffered her second miscarriage while six months' pregnant last November.

The singer said the experience had changed her outlook and spoke of how lucky she felt to have supportive friends and family.

She tweeted to her Twitter followers asking them not to watch the programme as she was "embarrassed" by it and felt press coverage had been "sensationalised"."Sex and the sitcom" may seem, on the face of it, an unpromising topic, at least in the context of British television. British sitcoms almost never feature sex. That's the whole point: they're about people who can't get any. Characters in British sitcoms are scared of sex (George in George and Mildred), or are too charmless to get it (Rigsby in Rising Damp), or are always boasting untruthfully about getting it (Jay in The Inbetweeners). They don't actually do it. Or if they do, they hardly ever do it on screen. (Mark and Jez from Peep Show have done it on screen - not with each other, obviously - but the whole horrible business is filmed using "point-of-view" camera angles, so all you ever see are comically unflattering close-ups of their big looming faces.)
All the same, last night's documentary on BBC Four was an enjoyable examination of how British sitcoms down the decades have looked at sex - nervously, most of the time, from between their fingers. Take BBC One's Meet the Wife, from 1964, which featured not the mildest allusion to sex, despite - or because of - being about a married couple. At this time, it was apparently considered more or less acceptable for film and TV drama to tackle sex, but not the sitcom, which was thought of as innocuous entertainment for all the family.
TV could still be amusing about sex, but mostly this was by accident. I very much enjoyed the footage from a public information broadcast about the Pill. "The day is printed by the side of every pill," announced the voice-over in clipped and curiously sour tones. "So, provided she can remember what day it is, a woman can be quite sure whether she's taken today's pill."
In the Seventies, sitcoms stopped ignoring sex and started giggling about it instead. I particularly liked the title of a little-remembered sitcom from 1971, It's Awfully Bad for Your Eyes, Darling. The Eighties saw the arrival of British TV comedy's first "cougar", an older woman who enjoys affairs with young men (Dorien Green, played by Lesley Joseph in Birds of a Feather); the Nineties gave us fetid, but also sweetly pathetic, laddishness (Men Behaving Badly). In the 21st century, we have Peep Show and The Inbetweeners - to judge by which, in the words of Leslie Phillips, there "seems to be very little limit as to how far you can go".
Actually, though, I'm not sure Peep Show and The Inbetweeners are so very different from the sitcoms of 30 or 40 years ago. Ooze with explicit sexual references though they may, their message about sex is almost comfortingly familiar: that it's dirty, that the idea of it makes you snigger, that you aren't likely to get it, and that in the rare event that you do, you're going to get it wrong. In the British sitcom, today as much as ever, there's nothing less sexy than sex.
Jean-Antoine Watteau (1684-1721) was the most talented and innovative painter in early 18th-century France. He was also an elusive, enigmatic and sickly young man, a victim of consumptive tuberculosis.
He invented a new form of painting, suspended between mythology and modern life, in which elegantly dressed men and women commune melancholically with one another in evocatively pastoral settings.
Perhaps the most famous of these allegorical puzzle-pictures was his reception piece for the French Academy, Pilgrimage to the Isle of Cythera: a deeply ambiguous painting of amorous revelry that looks less like a celebration of life and love than a lament for the certainty of its passing. In deference to Watteau＊s extreme originality, the Academy invented a new category to describe this kind of picture: the f那te galante.
"Watteau: The Drawings", a small but absorbing exhibition, focuses on a different aspect of his achievement. Watteau was one of the most sensitive and acute draughtsmen who ever lived, and this carefully distilled selection of some 90 drawings demonstrates the range of his genius and his emotional sympathies.

He was a master of the trois crayons method, combining red and black chalk with graphite to create subtle images full of life and light.
Whereas his paintings alchemise the world that he knew into a succession of bittersweet fantasies, his drawings capture that world in a series of compelling fragments.
Watteau depicts the Persians who visited Paris in a delegation in 1715, dwelling in fascination on the exoticism of their costumes and noting too the personalities of each.
He was also a wry observer of children, attentive both to their fresh, everchanging emotions 每 caught in a beautiful study of the same little girl＊s face at three instants 每 as well as their capacity for introversion and solemnity.
Watteau could make a brilliant drawing out of almost anything: he watches a man＊s hands in conversation, resting, fiddling, demonstrating, picking up a snuffbox, and preserves the whole sequence of motions on a single sheet as if measuring - in these fractured movements of just one part of the human body - the motions of thought.
Almost alone among his contemporaries, he observed the poor and drew them with a strong sense of sympathy. This is particularly true of his studies of Savoyards, itinerants forced to travel to Paris from their bitterly poor Alpine homeland to scrape a living.
Watteau＊s brilliance as a draughtsman may have been linked to his sense of his own predicament.
He died young, at just 36, and from contemporary accounts it seems as though he always knew he would not have long. With his eyes he caught at everything that he could, snagged it and kept it, all in skeins of line.Everyone knows that the battle over whether photography should be considered one of the fine arts was won long ago. But occasionally an exhibition makes you ponder the question afresh. The National Portrait Gallery＊s new exhibition, Ida Kar: Bohemian Photographer, devoted to the London-based Armenian photographer who died in 1974, is one such show.
Kar is not well known today, but the NPG considered her sufficiently talented to buy her entire archive, including 800 photographic prints and 10,000 negatives, just over a decade ago. It＊s debatable, though, whether her appeal derives from the artistry of her images or from the fact that she persuaded so many famous people to sit for her. I suspect it＊s the latter, and that Kar was hitching a ride on the coat-tails of stronger artistic personalities.
Born to Armenian parents in Russia in 1908, Kar lived in Paris during the late Twenties, a period of heady possibility for strong-willed female photographers (think of Dora Maar and Claude Cahun). In 1933, she returned to Egypt, where she had been educated, and married a government official.
Her life changed irrevocably during the war, when she met the British art dealer Victor Musgrave, who had been stationed in Cairo with the RAF. Kar divorced her first husband, married Musgrave, and followed him to London in 1945. She forged her reputation in Britain with a series of portraits of artists that were shown at Gallery One, which Musgrave set up in the early Fifties. Her work began to appear in magazines such as Tatler.
In 1960, she was honoured with an exhibition at the Whitechapel Art Gallery. This was the first one-person photographic show ever held in an important London space, and it helped the public to accept that photography could be fine art. Its polemical title was Ida Kar: Artist with a Camera.

International Photography Festival Round-up 06 Jan 2011
Looking at pictures of her Whitechapel retrospective, it＊s clear that Kar was meticulous about the presentation of her photographs, which she blew up at great cost, and left unframed. The National Portrait Gallery adopts a more conventional approach. All of the nearly 100 prints on show are both framed and relatively small, minimising and containing Kar＊s vision, such as it was.
For instance, a portrait of Jacob Epstein taken in 1953, in which the sculptor＊s hands hold a seemingly impossible position, as though his own body was subject to his titanic ability to mould material, is shown alongside two conventional studio portraits of film actors that date from the same period.
With their dramatic artificial lighting, the pictures of actors staring soulfully into the middle distance are hackwork, evidence of Kar＊s commissions as a self-styled ※theatrical photographer§ for the casting directory Spotlight. The portrait of Epstein, by contrast, is much more singular and accomplished. It was shown in a larger print in 1960, and should have been allowed to breathe by itself here, too.
No photographs predate Kar＊s move to London. This is a shame, because I would love to have seen the influence on her work of Surrealist Paris. Instead, for the most part, the exhibition consists of her portraits from the Fifties and Sixties.
There is no doubt that Kar was persistent and persuasive, shooting many of the biggest names of the day. In Britain, for instance, she captured Henry Moore, seen working at a distance, as well as Stanley Spencer, sitting indoors beneath an open umbrella, and John Piper, a dead ringer for the current manager of Wolverhampton Wanderers, Mick McCarthy. Kar also returned to Paris, where she photographed artists and writers including Chagall, Breton, Giacometti, Le Corbusier, Man Ray and Fernand L谷ger, who looks like a battered Gallic bruiser, with a face like a deflated leathery ※ballon§.
There is pleasure in seeing celebrated artists and writers in their ateliers and offices, of course. But the real question is whether Kar＊s photographs also contain valuable psychological insight, illuminating the sitters＊ personalities and work.
The catalogue contains several tributes assuring us that they transcend ※mere likeness§. But I am not so sure. Kar had a tendency to photograph artists in a formulaic manner. Too often, they appear neatly beside examples of their work. Kenneth Armitage sits in a pose that imitates a plaster model for one of his sculptures behind him; Reg Butler stands on a stepladder, echoing the standing figure he＊s working on.
Yves Klein is shown before one of his monochrome pieces, which has been artfully positioned so that it appears to bloom from his brain. This seems like a pleasing visual analogy for inspiration and the intimate relationship between an artist and his creation, but Kar employs the trope again and again 每 just compare her portraits of Moore, Feliks Topolski and Ossip Zadkine.
Moreover, her 1958 portrait of Doris Lessing, in which the writer stares dreamily into the distance while her hands intuitively tend to potted plants on the table in front of her, is a whopping clich谷: Kar suggests, with the subtlety of a sledgehammer, that Lessing＊s green fingers represent the natural fertility of her imagination.
There are exceptions. Augustus John, with glittering eyes and sparse, unkempt hair, looks like the incarnation of that ※grey-beard loon§, Coleridge＊s ancient mariner. An immaculately tailored Cecil Beaton stands in a conservatory, almost camouflaged by the riot of exquisitely cultivated hothouse vegetation that surrounds him, reminding us that the fashion photographer was a creature of artifice. There is a dizzy shot of the writer Colin MacInnes, one of Kar＊s lodgers, smoking on a bed, in which the entire room seems subtly to tip and keel to the right, suggesting queasy intoxication.
But, generally, Kar＊s portraits feel too reverential. The men she photographed were mostly culture＊s elder statesmen, staring at her lens with the self-knowledge of success. I wish she had combated their preening tendencies more often.
This exhibition pitches Kar as a ※bohemian§ photographer. She may have lived a bohemian life, but her photographs feel too mellow and middle-aged, and insufficiently rebellious. They offer few surprises, and, ultimately, lack zest.Royal Academician, CBE, Turner Prize-winner, multimillionaire, go-to guy for cities seeking a sculpture to flaunt their wealth (Chicago, Cloud Gate, 2004), go-to guy for cities seeking a sculpture to aid their regeneration (Middlesbrough, Temenos, 2010). And that＊s not to mention his 2009 retrospective at the Royal Academy, London＊s most popular show ever by a contemporary artist, attracting 280,000 visitors.
But then, last summer, came the first hint of a backlash. The public and pundits who had feted his beguiling, reality-dissolving sculptures 每 all mirrored surfaces or dark hollows 每 suddenly took exception to his plans for the ArcelorMittal Orbit tower at London＊s Olympic Park.
His 120-metre, red-steel jumble 每 dubbed ※The Mutant Helter Skelter§ and recalling Vladimir Tatlin＊s doomed Monument to the Third International in Petrograd 每 seemed less an artwork than a giant advert for its sponsor, the steel plutocrat Lakshmi Mittal.
Down the years, Anish Kapoor＊s abstracts have grown in direct proportion to his reputation: in May he unveils an installation at Paris＊ Grand Palais billed as ※the largest inflatable sculpture in the world§. But his Olympic tower seemed a hubristic step too high.

Modern British Sculpture, at Royal Academy, Seven magazine review 21 Jan 2011
In truth, some of us have been uneasy with the Anish worship for some time now, suspicious that his would-be-sublime sculptures are actually the artistic equivalent of a Paulo Coelho novel: pseudo-profundity for the masses. What＊s more, bigger isn＊t always better.
Which brings us to "Flashback", at Manchester Art Gallery, an utterly different, smaller, less bombastic retrospective than that at the RA. There, one work alone 每 Svayambh (2007), a huge block of red wax that shunted through Burlington House like a train 每 occupied five rooms to itself. Another, Shooting into the Corner (2009), a cannon firing 30 tons of red wax, occupied two. Here, by contrast, all 10 works are contained in just three rooms.
Organised by the Arts Council 每 drawing from its own collection, that of other public institutions, and a few recent pieces lent by the artist himself 每 "Flashback" ranges from the early Eighties (when Kapoor first emerged alongside fellow New British Sculptors, Tony Cragg and Richard Deacon) to the present day. Impressively, it manages to cover every material and period of Kapoor＊s career 每 apart, inevitably, from his recent lurch towards architecture.
We start with the highly coloured pigment of White Sand, Red Millet, Many Flowers, bought by the Arts Council in 1982. Its fragile mountains and molehills of red, black and yellow powder are reminiscent of the intensely hued rangoli, and also spice cones, of Kapoor＊s Indian youth.
Trademark, later works in red wax and hyper-polished stainless steel also feature, notably Tate＊s huge triptych Her Blood: three concave mirrors (one tinted red) placed in triangular configuration like a shiny cluster of airport radar-dishes, each resting against a different wall. Heathrow meets Versailles, our reflection distorting into various shapes and shades of crimson.
Void (1994), meanwhile, is a trademark work of negative space: a bowl-like protuberance from the wall, into whose blue, fibreglass hollow one＊s view is lengthily lost. It＊s like peering into oblivion.
With his mirrors and voids, Kapoor aspires to the sense of awe and mystery of church art, but without the specific religious baggage. By inducing what he terms a ※foggy field§ in our vision, Kapoor strives to serve up a transcendental experience in a secular age. And, to be fair, in isolated doses, as here, his hollows and reflections do appear much less gimmicky.
The majority of works in "Flashback" are from the first half of Kapoor＊s career, showcasing the Arts Council＊s foresight in purchasing a future superstar＊s work early 每 ie, when he was still affordable.
※It＊s always been exemplary in supporting work from emerging British artists,§ says Kapoor of the Council, which organised a similar exhibition of Bridget Riley＊s works last year. He＊s fully aware of the political bite to the Flashback series, at a time when the Arts Council faces 29.6 per cent funding cuts.
Among the newer pieces on show is 2005＊s Negative Box Shadow, a sharp, steel plate that bisects a big block of hardened, red wax.
It hints at a marked development in Kapoor＊s work, allied to that towards gigantism: namely that from female archetype to male. Gone are the sensuous mirrors and dark holes, in favour of shooting cannons, shunting trains and steel towers. His work＊s undergone something of a sex-change lately, and if evidence from Olympic Park is anything to go by, one kind of hopes it＊s reversible.The Bible compared it to sin. The Dutch made picturesque domestic paintings about it. The English laughed about it when it got too serious. India continues to be overwhelmed by it. And the Germans built a vast hygiene museum filled with scale models, to teach people how to overcome it.
There is no way to compile a history of man＊s relationship with dirt without being incomplete and flippant, or without simply reaffirming national stereotypes, as the Wellcome Collection＊s new exhibition shows. But the selection of art and objects on show do shed light on shifting attitudes towards filth, and the blurry line between the perceived and real threat that it has posed to man over the past 400 years. You may be aware that this exhibition follows the Wellcome＊s last one about drugs, so do not be put off by a blurb at the entrance that inanely describes dirt as ※one of society＊s last taboos§.
The curators have cleverly avoided falling into the themed-show trap of over-generalising and attempting to be too ※relevant§. Dirt is divided into six parts, and takes you time-travelling, Doctor Who-like, through different worlds, from the pristine Protestant homes of 17th-century Delft to the founding in 1930 of the Deutsches Hygiene-Museum, via cholera-riddled Victorian London.
The best thing about the show is the thoughtful questioning that this journey encourages. Even in a city named after the action of delving into the dirty waters of the river (Delft), why were the Dutch so pious and earnest about cleanliness, taking great pains to paint brooms and servants into their famously clean paintings of domestic life? Yet in England, the Victorian era＊s best cartoonists made an excellent trade from parodying the extreme lengths people went to to avoid choleric germs.
The second best thing about the show is an item from the GDR that travelled around Germany as part of a touring Hygiene Exhibition in the 1960s: the 1954 Model of Tidy and Untidy Workshop. It is literally that. Can an object ever have underestimated the power of imagination more profoundly?

Is dirt really such a Bad Thing? 22 Mar 2011
As an art exhibition, Dirt is disappointing. There is little by way of visual impact, which feels like an opportunity missed. Santiago Sierra＊s colossal and visceral 2006 sculpture is startling, though. Even passing through exhibits from a hospital in 1867 Glasgow does not prepare you for 5 Anthropometric Modules made from Human Faeces by the People of Sulabh International, India.
Sculpture aside, this exhibition feels as if it relies too heavily on some quite mundane and random objects (a urine flask, a laundry basket, dust).
This fascinating subject might be better as a coffee table book, perhaps, or 每 more appropriately 每 excellent lavatorial browsing.Within Jeremy Hunt＊s Department of Culture, Media and Sport, Ed Vaizey is the junior minister with special responsibility for the arts. Having watched him closely at functions and press conferences over recent months, I can tell that he is not a happy bunny.
We have had several incompetents in the job in recent memory, but I have never seen anyone who looks as bored, truculent and uneasy as he does. I guess he hates the job and that either he has lost all interest in the arts themselves and is sick of their acolytes shouting abuse at him, or else he doesn＊t really believe in the regime of cuts he has been charged to execute.
Should this man have the power to decide which arts organisations receive grants from government? Should his drones at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (or by proxy in local authorities) be instructed to make the more detailed calculations as to who should get how much?
I know Arts Council England is disliked by most quango-bashing Conservatives 每 and a lot of the arts establishment as well 每 but I believe that the right answer to those questions is no, and that an Arts Council that keeps government at arm＊s length from matters of artistic discrimination, remains the least bad option. I raise two cheers for its survival.
I hold the third cheer back because its performance has never been first-rate. Under New Labour, it spent an enormous amount of money on itself, and internally it hasn＊t been tightly managed. Now, slimmed down to skin and bone by the cuts, it is providing much better value for money, and I think the Government＊s demands for further reductions in its establishment are punitive and counter-productive.
The chairman, Liz Forgan, and chief executive, Alan Davey, are punching hard, and I hear good things on the ground about officers responsible for individual organisations 每 no longer ※the computer says no§ types concerned only with the ticking of boxes, but engaged and informed people with experience of the art form to which they are assigned.
They are faced with a ghastly prospect. Over the next four years, the DCMS＊s grant to ACE will decline in stages by 29.6 per cent, from ㏒449 million to ㏒350 million. About 1,400 organisations have currently applied for three years of funding. In the recent past, about 850 have received awards; this year, the ACE reckons that only 750 will get through, and of those most will face a cut of about 15 per cent by 2014.
I believe, to put it very crudely, that under New Labour, the arts sector became over-heated, over-supplied and extravagant to the point where a brisk clear-out of 10 per cent of total activity wouldn＊t do the culture much lasting harm.
But these figures, on top of local authority cuts, inflation and general belt-tightening, suggest that an overall drop of 20 per cent in income and provision is more like it. The ACE insists that it won＊t deal out equal misery all round. Some organisations will get rises, some new clients will be added to the portfolio. It＊s not a conflagration, but there＊s certainly going to be a bonfire and the Big Society will have to spring smartly into action if local art galleries or theatres are to have a chance of prospering.
The ACE will publish its judgments at the end of March. The process of culling must be agonising, and I don＊t suppose there will be positively good news for many. But I hope that success will be rewarded without fear or favour 每 and that means flagships such as the Royal Opera House and the National Theatre as well as brave new experiments in the regions.
The money must be fairly spread across centres of population, to ensure that everyone has reasonable annual access to some opera, ballet, theatre, classical music and contemporary art. But geographical factors alone shouldn＊t weigh too heavily. Size of audiences is not a criterion: it＊s assessment of quality that should be paramount, subjective though this may be.
Quality should also remain the beacon when considering what has become known as the ※instrumental§ argument for state subsidy. Through education and outreach programmes, the arts can do their bit to offer uplifting opportunities to disturbed youths, deprived housing estates and the sick and elderly. Marvellous work has been done in these areas, and it should be recognised.
But the arts do not have value only as extensions of the welfare state. They do not merit our attention or a tiny tithe of our taxes because they make us good citizens or even because they cheer us up. They must be supported simply because they are the supreme expression of our humanity.
Imagine a world without art, imagine a nation without plays, orchestras or paintings. Imagine a people who did not sing or write poetry or have any concept of beauty. You cannot.
On a more practical note, once ACE has made its choices, three important issues must be addressed. The first is the question of what should be done with the large pot of money sitting in the Arts Lottery. Present regulations strictly delimit how this can be used 每 originally on capital projects only. But capital projects are far less urgent now: most arts organisations have had their Lottery refit, and we certainly don＊t need any new concert halls or art galleries, so steps must be taken to ensure that a fair percentage of lottery income (about ㏒200 million a year) can go where it is most needed.
Secondly, someone has to argue with the Treasury so that giving to the arts becomes more fiscally advantageous to the donors. And thirdly, arts organisations must become more imaginative and hard-headed about swelling their income streams. Fortune will favour the bold.
Lastly, I wonder if Ed Vaizey could be gently moved to some field that he finds more rewarding. Putting him and his retinue out to pasture would save a couple of million quid, which could be reassigned to better causes.
And, remind me, what exactly does a Minister for the Arts do anyway?A sculpted low-energy lightbulb by a British designer took the top award in the international design prize.

The bulb uses 80% less energy and lasts eight times longer than an incandescent one.
Deyan Sudjic, director of the Design Museum, labelled it a worthy winner that was both "beautiful and smart".
He said: "It's a bulb that doesn't need a shade and so goes a long way to make up for the loss of the Edison original."
Panel member Will Self said: "If you'll forgive the pun, they are definitely a light leading the way... We felt these bulbs were neat, appealing and covetable in the right, affordable way."
The winning and shortlisted designs will be on show at the Brit Insurance Designs of the Year exhibition at the Design Museum until August 7.The human body is an amazing thing, and there are some amazing things to be done with cells from the human body.
These images show how live cells being used in world-leading research and taken from microscope images and live cell signalling can be manipulated into a variety of digital shapes, drawings and animations.
The process has been a long and exhaustive one for the artist, Jo Berry, who took a step into the unkown by enrolling as an undergraduate research student for six months at Nottingham University＊s School of Biomedical Sciences, where scientists are studying how the hormone ghrelin and their receptors, which determine how hungry we feel, stimulate human cells.
The long-term objective for the scientists is to help sufferers of conditions including eating disorder and obesity using ghrelin to literally switch on and off hunger by either blocking or stimulating the appetite.
Berry＊s project, Hijacking Natural Systems, which is being funded by the Wellcome Trust and Art Council England, involved taking the latest microscope images and Zeiss software back to her studio in Carsington, Derbyshire, and manipulating them to create a series of remarkable short films, vinyl drawing and multi-layered sculptured lightboxes, the results of which will be shown in a variety of locations in Derby, and later Nottingham, from this summer.
Her work included changing the speed of the live cell imagery; Projection 3D Views; Stereo Images; Stereo movies; and splitting images & animating live cell imagery, as well as digital drawings taken from the original cell images.
※The process of working in a facility where they are doing such important research, and taking that research, its software and imagery to create something cutting edge and entirely different has been incredible,§ she said.
※I experienced a full range of imaging techniques and observed the differences between traditional confocal microscopy and automated imaging systems. I also had the opportunity to try advanced imaging methods such as total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy, and the use of more physiological cell systems (human neutrophils).
※I was able to play about with colour, cutting and pasting, speeding up and slowing down films, making stereo images and looking at cells from different three-dimensional views - taking the science and software and approaching it from a different angle.§
The two scientific aims of the project involved demonstrating that ghrelin receptor trafficking within cells could be quantified and used to derive the pharmacology of different types of ghrelin receptor drug, and to study how drugs interact with the ghrelin receptor, using confocal microscopy.
She said: ※The project is celebrating the human body, the use of new technology, the collaboration between science and art, and also gives the public the opportunity to see art in a non-traditional setting.
※The hormone we studied is in us all, helping us decide when to eat, so the inspiration behind the work is part of everyone. I really want people who do not usually go to art galleries to come along and enjoy what they see, and see how exciting putting science and art together can be.§
The project, called Hijacking Natural Systems, goes on show in Derby from July. Based at the city＊s Museum and Art Gallery, artwork will also be displayed on bus stops and in shop windows across the city.Early in the morning of February 2 1829, the choristers walking to York Minster saw sparks flying out of the roof of the cathedral. Soon it became apparent that a fire was raging in the great church. A bystander 每 gazing at the architecture and fire-fighters illuminated by red glow of the conflagration 每 is supposed to have remarked that the whole scene looked exactly like a painting by John Martin.
If that anecdote＊s not true, it＊s certainly apt, because this disaster was not caused by accident but arson. It was started by Jonathan Martin, an older sibling of the artist. He was an ex-preacher who had been placed in an asylum for threatening to assassinate the Bishop of Oxford, but escaped and became dangerously obsessed with York Minster.
His younger brother, John (1789-1854), had been hailed two years previously in 1827 by Sir Thomas Lawrence as ※the most popular painter in England§. An exhibition of his epic paintings of divine vengeance, the fall of ancient civilisation, the end of the world and sundry cataclysms, is on view at the Laing Art Gallery, and will be at Tate Britain in the autumn.
John Martin the painter 每 who paid for his brother＊s defence at the subsequent trail 每 is an eccentric of art history. He came from a humble background. Born in a one-room cottage at Haydon Bridge, near Hexham, Northumberland, Martin worked as a painter of coaches and china before earning renown for his spectacular pictures.
His family was strange; in addition to the mad arsonist Jonathan, the oldest brother William was an obsessive opponent of Newton＊s theory of gravity, a view he expounded in Newcastle wearing a tortoise＊s shell for a hat. John, the youngest, was brilliant, good looking and 每 except for a habit of snorting loudly while conversing and unpopularity caused by his habit of hissing the National Anthem 每 charming.

Many regarded Martin in his heyday as a great British artist, surpassed only by his older contemporary, Turner. He became official painter to Leopold of Saxe-Coburg, Victoria＊s uncle, later King of Belgium, who was godfather to his son. After his death, his reputation slumped.
Martin had deficiencies as a painter which Jeremy Maas, expert on Victorian art, enumerated. These included a garish colour sense, ※poor painting of figures§ and ※his treatment of foliage, which looks like dried sponge§. Yet Martin had one great strength. As Maas added, he was ※an incomparable showman§.
The painting that made his name, and prompted that toast from Lawrence, was Belshazzar＊s Feast (1821). Of that Martin said before it was exhibited, ※it shall make more noise than any picture ever did before＃ only don＊t tell anyone I said so§. And it did create a huge stir. Large numbers of engravings of it were sold, and 5,000 people paid to see it.
Belshazzar＊s Feast represented Martin＊s favoured subject: destruction on a colossal scale. The titles of his paintings give a sense of the apocalyptic tendency of Martin＊s imagination: the Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, the Fall of Babylon, the Fall of Nineveh. Divine vengeance was a frequent theme.
Writing in the catalogue for the Fall of Nineveh in 1827, Martin explained how in such cases ※strict truth is not essential§. There was no reason not to go for the most eye-popping spectacle one could dream up. Or as Martin put it: ※Seen through the mist of ages, the great becomes the gigantic, the wonderful swells into the sublime.§
Archaeologists had not investigated the ruins of the ancient Middle East, so Martin was free to make it all up 每 with relish. Even more to his taste was the end of the world. His last works dealt with the Last Judgment and its aftermath. The Great Day of His Wrath (1851-1853), in which mountains tumble in a sort of combined earthquake and volcanic explosion, had lightning streaking across the sky and naked people tumbling into an abyss. Martin was at his best as a fire and brimstone man. Not for nothing is a new book about him by Barbara C Morden entitled Apocalypse Now!.
In some ways, he fits more easily into the prehistory of cinema than of painting. The three Judgment Pictures went on tour in Britain and the United States. For years after his death they were a travelling attraction billed as ※the most sublime and extraordinary pictures in the world＃ valued at 8,000 guineas§.
Martin is said to have influenced the Hollywood epic of D?W Griffith and Cecil B DeMille, with his taste for spectacular special effects and casts of thousands.
He also promoted schemes which were visionary in a different sense. Among his projects were plans to bring London pure water from the River Colne, embank the Thames, build a circular London railway 每 a predecessor of the Circle Line 每 and to create a modern sewage disposal system for the capital. The latter was 25 years in advance of Joseph Bazalgette＊s successful plan. But the complete failure of his Metropolitan Sewage Manure Company in 1850 almost ruined Martin.
There was a connection between his preoccupation with cataclysmic doom and his plans for urban improvement. Many in the 19th century felt the world was heading for disaster. Martin＊s inspiration for the Great Day of His Wrath was a journey he made at night through the fiery landscape of the Black Country with its mines, foundries and pollution. It must have looked apocalyptic.
