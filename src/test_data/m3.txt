I agree with the statement tha improving schools is the most important factor in successful development of a country.As is known to all, education is critical to the develpment of a country. Education to a country, is as water to fish and air to people. A fair education system can  nourish elites in every field, who can contribute a lot to the development of a country. Then, schools are the place for education, so improving schools is  so important that the country should pay more attention to it.The development of a country is based on talented people, and a variety of people are need in every field. For instance, the excellent archetists are needed for the integret development of the city, well-educated  teachers are needed for the development of schools, medical experts are needed for the medcial care system, and technitians are needer for the development of science and technique. Above all the people are cultured in the schools, and there will be no elites above without education, or improving schools.For instance, I live in a moderate city in China. Several decades ago, our city was developing slowly. Then a college was establishn there. With the help of the gradute students, great changes have taken place in our city. The factories are more efficient than the past with new technique, which is brought in through the college. Many other industies were explored at the range of the elites from the college. Nowadays our city is much more prosperous than the past. I think, improving schools can cause our city great change, so does it to the whole country.In a word, education is of great impantance to the development of a country. And a country which wants to be developed need to develop their education first, which means improving schools.
