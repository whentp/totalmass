a particular state in respect of the states of being a merchant.9 Second, the fact that
nationality does not play a role in determining the applicability of the CISG is
an advantage with regard to the use of the CISG since it releases parties from an
inquiry into the nationality of the other contracting party or parties, and in particular
from the sometimes difficult question of the nationality of a legal person.10
The following discussion on the UCC rules in regard to ¡°who is a merchant¡±
illustrates the sometimes rather difficult inquiry into this issue: under the UCC
merchants are professionals in business. The professional status may be based
upon specialised knowledge of the goods, specialised knowledge of business prac-
tices, or both.
The UCC distinguishes between two types of merchants. First, under ¡ì 2-314
UCC a merchant is considered to be someone selling a specific good and having
special knowledge about it. Secondly, a more relaxed type of merchant is envis-
aged by ¡ì 2-201(2), ¡ì 2-207, ¡ì 2-209 UCC which covers nearly everyone in busi-
ness. Therefore, practically most sales of goods will be conducted by a merchant
under the UCC.11

The above mentioned requirements will mean that for the most part,
tribunals which have to decide upon its application to a particular matter will be in
one of the member states to the CISG and the CISG, in turn, will be one of the
laws which belongs to the natural realm of the tribunal.
However, the CISG can also be applied by a court of a non-member state. Take
for example, a scenario where the parties¡¯ places of business are in different mem-
ber states but the dispute comes before a tribunal in a non-member state12 and
the private international law of the tribunal in the non-member state leads to the
application of the law of a member state to the CISG. In such a case, the tribunal
or court will have to apply the CISG as the tribunal or court of the member-state
would do.The reason for referring to the law of a CISG member state through the
application of the forum state¡¯s private international law rules is irrelevant:
whether the law of a member state is applicable because the contract has its most
significant relationship15 in that state or because of the parties¡¯ express or implied
choice is not important. However, if the parties choose the law of a CISG member
state, an issue sometimes arises as to whether the parties chose the law of that state
in toto, or only the domestic sale of goods law and thereby intended to exclude the
application of the CISG as permitted by Article 6 CISG. The question of whether
a general reference to national law includes a reference to the CISG is disputed in
the case law and academic writing.16 In the authors¡¯ view, unless the parties have
expressly referred to the domestic sales law of a state the reference to the national
law of a member state either through private international law or by the choice of
the parties includes the CISG.17 In each individual circumstance, the intention of
the parties should be considered by applying Article 8 CISG.18
Some authors are of the opinion that the reference to the national law of a
member state must be read as excluding a reference to the CISG if Article 1(1)(a)
is applicable (if, say, both parties have their seats in member states) because
otherwise the parties¡¯ express choice of law could be rendered meaningless.19
The reference to the law of a member state can result in the application of
the CISG even if the parties are from different states but neither of the parties
has its seat in a member state. This scenario, anticipated in Article 1(1)(b) CISG,
has been a concern since the parties are subjected to a sale of goods law, namely
the CISG, which is not applicable to either of the parties as part of its national
law. Article 1(1)(b) CISG was, therefore, very controversial during its drafting
in Vienna.21 However, Article 1(1)(b) CISG is justifiable in that it is easier for a
judge to apply the CISG, which is easily accessible, is printed in many languages
(six official languages and 13 unofficial languages), and has been subjected to
jurisprudential and academic analysis on the world stage. The alternative is for a
judge to have to apply a national law which might be inaccessible for him or her
and in his or her view very obscure. This is also true for the parties. Even if the
applicability of the CISG comes as a surprise to the parties, the CISG devises a
legal paradigm for specific problems arising out of cross-border sales of goods
contracts often more modern than a domestic sale of goods law. But importantly, the
advantage of the domestic sale of goods law can only ever be afforded to one party
whereas the CISG is more advantageous because it is ¡°neutral¡± as between the parties.The reservations against and disagreements with regard to Article 1(1)(b)
CISG resulted in the adoption of Article 95 CISG which allows member states to
implement the CISG without being bound by Article 1(1)(b) CISG (¡°will not be
bound by¡±).24 Therefore, when considering the application of the CISG, one has to
keep in mind that member states, member states with an Article 95 CISG reser-
vation, and non-member states exist side-by-side. If the CISG is only applicable
because of private international law rules, confusing situations can occur.25 How-
ever, as discussed above,26 the function of Article 1(1)(b) CISG should be under-
stood as being one of distributing the contract law of the member states: where a
member state, because of an Article 95 CISG reservation, has made Article 1(1)(b)
CISG inapplicable, then the member state signals that it wants, when private inter-
national law rules refer to its law, not that the CISG applies, but rather its domestic
sale of contract law applies. In such a case, the CISG can only be applied if the
requirements for the application of Article 1(1)(a) CISG are met (that is, both parties
have their places of business in a member state). The decision of a national legislature
in a ¡°reservation member state¡± has to be respected even if it is a foreign court 27
whose private international law rules lead to the law of a reservation member state.
