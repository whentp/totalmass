Subsidy is one of the most controversial and important issues in WTO sphere since the establishment of WTO. Each member country would deal with problems aroused by this issue more or less, this essay attempts to make a discussion on subsidy.
According to the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (hereinafter, ¡°SCM¡±), ¡®Subsidy¡¯ is defined as a financial contribution by a government or any public body within the territory of a Member which confers benefit . 
Basically, talking about subsidy, there are three fundamental elements which a subsidy must process are: it should be a (1) financial contribution by a (2) government or any public body within the territory of a Member which (3) confers benefit. All these three elements must be satisfied. As financial contribution, it should be a direct or a potential transfer of funds or liabilities given by the government or any public body. Grant, loans and loan guarantee all fit in this category. And benefits must be brought to the subsidized objects with the financial contribution.
However not all the subsidies are regulated by WTO, only specific subsidies are concerned within the scope of WTO regulations. The specific subsidy is further divided to four types in refers to Article 2 and Article3 SCM which are enterprise-specificity, industry ¨Cspecificity, regional specificity and prohibited Subsidies.  
According to SCM, Article2.1(a), ¡°Where the granting authority, or the legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates, explicitly limits access to a subsidy to certain enterprises, such subsidy shall be specific.¡± 
The method to identify whether the subsidy is specific laid on the PPG Industries, Inc. v. United States,  (the ¡°PPG Case¡±) which brought out the Specificity Test. The test is used to determine the specificity of the subsidy was applied. In the PPG case, the standard was that if a subsidy is provided to the specific enterprise, industry or group of enterprises or industries, then such a subsidy can be levied with an anti-subsidy tax without being investigated; if a subsidy is provided to all the industries nominally, but in practice, only certain enterprises, industry or groups of enterprises or industries will apply, then such a subsidy also can be levied with an anti-subsidy tax. 
II.	Three categories of subsidy under SCM: the Traffic Light Schema
In the aspect of whether the subsidy can result the countervailing measures, all subsides fall into three categories according to SCM which are prohibited subsidies, non-actionable subsidies and actionable subsidies. This method is also known as ¡°light schema¡± first brought up by America in Tokyo round. According to this schema, prohibited subsidies are the ¡°red light¡± subsidies, non-actionable subsidies are the ¡°green light¡± subsidies (The non-actionable category expired after five years and no longer exists. ) and the actionable subsidies are the most complicated situations called ¡°yellow lights¡± subsidies. All these categories are created to help recognizing the beneficial and the pernicious effects caused by the subsidies depending on how they are constructed. This schema plays an important role in the WTO system for it can be used by the countries to argue for their own way to stimulate the economic development within reasonable limits.
Prohibited subsidies are not allowed in any circumstances under SCM. It refers to such subsidies that the members cannot authorize or maintain. If a member party is spotted to have applied prohibited subsidy, any affected members are authorized to take countervailing measures against it. Export subsidies and domestic-content subsidies are the two types which are strictly prohibited by SCM, in other words, they are subsidies contingent upon the export of a good or service, or that requires the subsidized producers to use domestic inputs.  With regards to Article 3.1(a) SCM, ¡°subsidies contingent, in law or in fact, whether solely or as one of several other conditions, upon export performance¡­¡± should be deemed as prohibited subsidy. However, the fact that giving subsidy merely to the export industries itself cannot be treated as prohibited, that is to say, tough SCM restricts the prohibited subsidy, the purpose it exams is the real motivation of the countries behind the subsidy. If the subsidy given by country member can not fit into the scope of prohibited subsidy, it shall not be prohibited.  
In Brazil v Canada (WT/DS222), Brazil brought up that Canada gave subsidy to the aircraft manufacturer depending on the export performance which was prohibited by SCM. However, Canada did not deny the financing programme but denied it was bound to the export performance and benefited the accepter. The Panel requested Brazil to bear the burden of proof to prove its charge. But Brazil failed to do so.  As a result, Panel dismissed Brazil¡¯s charge. This case indicates that WTO values justice and fairness greatly so that to protect the country member¡¯s legal right and prevent them from abusing litigation as well.
Green light subsidies refer to those subsidies are beneficial to the developments of research, environment and region, so that they are non-actionable, which means they can be laid out without concerning being challenged by other members. The most significant character of non-actionable subsidies is they must not be specific subsidies.
It is resulted from the negotiations. Proposed by America, those subsidies allow governments¡¯ greater scope in providing assistance to industries or universities to finance research should by green light ones. And the environmental clause was brought up by Mexico, which enables to allow subsidies to companies or industries to adapt to stricter environmental regulations. The third one concerning about regional development was put forward to allow governments to provide redistributive assistance to regions that are not as developed. 
Technically speaking, green light subsidies are provisional and contemporary unactionable for officially this category expired in 2000 after members could not agree to its extension. However, members are still offering subsidies under this permission with the risk to be challenged. Though this issue is still being discussed in Doha Round, little achievement has been made as so far.
The subsidies are not prohibited by SCM but have a possibility to be challenged by other members in accordance to the specific situation are the last category, namely, yellow light subsidies. Under certain scope, member party can subsidies the manufacturers or the sellers if the subsidy does not create adverse affects to other members. If it does, then the injured party can bring the issue to the WTO's Dispute Settlement Body (DSB). Such ¡°adverse effect¡± as injury to the domestic industry of another Member, nullification or impairment of benefits accruing directly or indirectly to other Members under GATT 1994 and serious prejudice, including a threat thereof, to the interests of another Member. 
Most subsidies fall into this particular category for it is controversial to determine whether the subsidy is allowable or not. For the reason that none of these adverse effects are easy to prove and can involve complex and lengthy determinations. 
III.	Special and Differential Treatment of Developing Country Members
Subsidy plays an important role in stimulating the economic scheme in developing country members, therefore SCM makes special and differential treatment to them in Part VIII.  SCM categorizes developing country members to three types which are: least-developed countries designated as such by the United Nations, GNP per capita is below $1,000 per annum  and other develop countries and regions.  SCM regulates these countries from three aspects.
First of all is prohibited subsidy. SCM allows the least-developed countries and whose GNP per capita is below $1,000 per annum to apply export subsidy. On the other hand, other developing countries members should gradually cancel the export subsidy in 8 years since the WTO agreement is effective without increasing the export subsidy during the 8 years. If developing country members deem it necessary to apply the subsidy continuously after the 8-year-period, it shall enter into consultation with Committee no later than one year ahead to be decided.
Besides, import substitution subsidies can be no longer applied by developing country members than 5 years after the WTO agreement entered effective. However, this time limitation extends to 8 years to the least developing country members.
Second aspect is the differential treatment to the actionable subsidies. According to Article 27.9 SCM, ¡°actionable subsidies granted or maintained by a developing country Member other than those referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 6, action may not be authorized or taken under Article 7 unless nullification or impairment of tariff concessions or other obligations under GATT 1994 is found to exist as a result of such a subsidy, in such a way as to displace or impede imports of a like product of another Member into the market of the subsidizing developing country Member or unless injury to a domestic industry in the market of an importing Member occurs.¡±  However, the complaint not only has to prove the existence of the subsidy, but also the serious injury is resulted from the subsidy.
Thirdly, with regarding to countervailing duty investigation, it shall pause when the two situations occur: (1) the overall level of subsidies granted upon the product in question does not exceed 2 per cent of its value calculated on a per unit basis; or (2)the volume of  subsidized import products are less than 4% of the like products imported by the country member in total, unless the volume of like products from the developing country member accesses beyond 9% of the complaint¡¯s total importing.
It can be seen that SCM¡¯s different regulations vary from different subsidies. Provided that neither the economy nor the competitiveness of developing countries is equal to the developed countries, they can not be treated exactly as the same standard of SCM without exceptions, or it will lead to an actual unfair. Therefore, SCM expresses it concentration to developing countries through special and differential treatments to make the balance. China, as a comparable under developed country, should pay more attention to these rules as to make its own benefit.
IV.	Countermeasures for China to response to the SCM
Facing with the current situation, China, as a growing leading power of developing country member, has to seek better strategy to deal with the reality.
I want to give some advice in three aspects, namely, environment, service industry and to the backward areas.
Nowadays, the focus put on environmental requirements is becoming the new barrier in the global trade field; however, coming with it is the new opportunities. China should take full advantage of the environmental subsidies which belongs to actionable subsidies with reference to SCM. On one hand, to lower the cost of manufacture, on the other hand, to characterize the environmental industry to become a new growth point and to create favourable condition to break the green barrier. 
Government may give enterprises direct environmental subsidies so that the manufacturers can use eco-friendly ways to process their works and meet the environmental requirements of the import countries.
Environmental facilities are special kinds of investment. Through helping the enterprises to upgrade such facilities, government makes public facilities as well. For example, if government helps to build up a sewage treatment plant for a paper mill, it does not only release the paper mill¡¯s environmental burden but also protects the local water system which serves two ends.
With respect to the service industry, the portion which service trade occupies in international trade has already exceeded 25%, and around 65% of this portion is contributed by the developed countries. It illustrates that the service industry is playing a more and more important role in the international trade and is making more and more profits. So my recommendation to Chinese government is to promote the whole service industry for the actuality in China is that the service industry only devotes 31% of GDP and there is a large space remaining to improve. 
Preference of policy can be imposed on service industry by giving grant and tax preference. And grant should be given to education and scientific research so that China can develop its strong points, avoid its weaknesses, and win a favorable position. In certain areas as satellite launching technique and construction, China has its own advantage comparing to the other countries, therefore, government should seize the chance to make greater progress on these programs to achieve a higher standard and takes the lead of the world. 
In fact, there are vast areas in China which still remains impoverished for instance, the northwest of China. Provided that SCM allows subsidising the least developed regions, Chinese government can fully take this allowance to make its effort to develop the northwest.
V.	Conclusion
Although I have talked about subsidy for that much, but whether subsidy is harmful or not? In fact, subsidy gives extra support to domestic producers or exporters which to the enterprises, comes from free. Due to this reason, the prices of the goods will be lower for subsidy makes up a certain part of the cost price. So the selling price with profit will also be under the market price, which may attract a lot of consumers to purchase this subsidized product. As a result, it usually will generate a dangerous situation that monopoly and unfair competition would be very possible to take place and also domestic industry of the like products in the importing country would be affected. So the answer to the question in the beginning is definitely a No.
