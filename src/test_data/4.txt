It make me sleepless all night, and this morning when I'm going to sleep, the big noise came from the downstairs, some guys is doing his decoration, so I decide to get up and write something in the bolg.
But when I prepare something of the matters, I found actually I can't say nothing of the issues...
Something mentioned to the personal issues.
It's really sad.
Anyway, I just release my angry and helpless here. Today I need fight back to that JP.









Keep a good habbit, force to wirte down what you met and thought everyday.
This is a diary for yesterday...
Life still goes on no matter who you are and how mess your life is. So i made a plan, at least it's good plan for me.
First, keep a fixed daily schedule, get up at 8am every morning and go to bed at 12pm.
Second, study Janpanese at least one hour, i gave it up one and half year before, now, i realized i need catch it again.
Though i dislike Janpanese or to some extend i hate them, like in this big earthquake and tsunami to cause thousands of life died, except a little sympth from my deep heart, i still think they are not good people and deserved it.
I know it a litte cruel until i read an article from newspaper, in 1923, Japan met an equal huge earthquake in we called GuanDong area, 177 Chinese labors to go there to do something to help Japanese, but you can't image what terrible thing happened, the Japanese bitch massacred them just they are Chinese (one Chinese survive).
And ridiculously, in China mainland, a lots of people, we can call then kind or stupid, devote anything they have just want to help those killer....
I tell the truth, if somebody don't believe what i told, you can check the history and see what the real history told.
Maybe current very famous "WS" should read the article more.
This is maybe not the topic i mentioned today, but who care, this is my bolg.
Third thing, keep a quiet attitude of the current status, CHANCE WILL GO TO YOU SOON.









this is the second blog i wrote down, i try to make my step of the life clear in somewhere, maybe somedays i can review and then feel happy or funny..
anyway, this is today's story.
even i'm still in the mess of the old business, i still encourage myself to go to today's interview, it's four-year-later interview, what supprise me is i already worked here nearly 4 years. look back now, i definitely think a lot of the past 4 year life, it's just like a dream and not true, but i know it's true actually. and also IT IS PAST.
don't know how to descible the interviw, feel not good, of course it'll be ridicous if it's ok, i am not prepared very well.
just talk with the guys and make up the words i can think. but the result looks not very bad, got a phonecall from the job-hunting lady, as if i can get the second chance, i got 50-60% chance to go to the second round. to some degree, a little funny.
i nearly lost between the job and life now, the normal thinking told me i need money to support my life and deep inside i want a easy life to do something i want to do or i like to do.
it's a dilemma, i'm stuck now.
maybe it's a sad thing for a man...
  














this month is not a luck month for me, too many things need handle.
and the serious world teach me, even it is not what i really want need, how to be a mature man with self-duty.
anyway, hope and sure i'll be on the right way from now.
also, it's good time to me to charge myself again.
i even can't remember how long i didn't touch the paper-book. i alway spent my time to read the e-books and just for relexion. now i realize it's very important to sit down and study something to make up what i alway missed last four years.
it's still not too later to do that, anyway, i'm still young, at least from my heart :)
