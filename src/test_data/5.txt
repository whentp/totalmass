
Today, I spend two thirds day in picking up unfamiliar words from vocabulary book of application for admission to USTC and one third recording my first song for my love.
I do not have enough time to collect words, coz I have to remember these new words and summarize the grammar, translation and composition. Too many to remember, henh? But I start to like learning English, coz I can use them to write my blog or tell to my girlfriend immediately after I have learned them. It seems like to meet old friends after long depart to read the words I have known and it is also like to acquaint with some freshmen to pick up unfamiliar words from vocabulary book.
The most exciting thing happened today is that I write my first song for my love, that rhythm comes several weeks ago when I left my love to return to university. It was a real happy weekend. I was not willing to leave my love but I had to. Then back to school in that complex mood, I got that rhythm. I also wrote down some lyrics for the rhythm, but not complete. Maybe my love can give me more idea and we can complete the song together in future. I am glad she likes it as gift for her birthday, especially when we can not meet each otherJ










There is a women on this earth could drive me crazy. I can¡¯t stand her slow reaction, or no reaction, no sense about the other¡¯s feeling. In my heart, girls are always careful and sensitive, but she is not. Today, I was nervous about my unfinished task on preparation for examination and had little time to fulfill the work. She spoke to me and asked something nonsense and under her poor and slow English, We couldn¡¯t communicate fluently, which make me more worried about valuable time. So I hanged off the cell phone in rush, which made me even angrier about her and myself. I behaved rude, I felt guilty and I couldn¡¯t continue my work. It seems like I am always impatient to her under some circumstance again and again, I don¡¯t know how to do our relation. I don¡¯t want to complain anymore later, it is nonsense£¡  










Someone in this world you care about most, can hurt you most. Coz he or she lies in your deepest heart, any trivial problem can intrigue a large disaster. Today, I did sth, to end a relationship, to rescue my life, but to hurt the other¡¯s soul deeply.
I want both of us be happy in our lives, these valuable, treasure lives, that just one time for each. The couple I wish to be in should be like this: we know the thought in each other without any words, we understand each other from bottom of heart, and expect to do sth useful to the other, when days are insipid, we enjoy this normal life and have fun with it; when difficult, we encourage each other; when stormy, we hold each other;
I met a girl so kind to me that maybe no one else would be. Maybe that is her love, but I am not very happy sometime. Especially when together but nothing to do and this make me feel boring. I had forgot the happy time in my college when we got our volleyball championship in competition after fierce and tough game that we totally engaged in. I became acceptable about everything that I like or not. I had lost my passion to life, but only worry about our relationship and gloomy future ahead of us which I expected to be beautiful at first and gradually merged into daily complain about hard jobbing, unwilling of her parents to our relationship and difficulty in buying a house in Beijing.
Finally, I can¡¯t endure this high pressure life especially when I doubt with truth of my emotion and I don¡¯t want to disguise that I love her, which is irresponsible for both of us.
I am so guilty about things that hurt her physically and psychologically and make me totally a jerk. I am so sorry.
I am glad that she find a true love of her own and want to hear the laughter when she is with her friend, which seldomly appears when we together.
I wish this instant hurt can pass away and bring her true happiness of life.













I¡¯m a sensitive man or boy, I think. I always concern my self. Little unpleasant thing in my heart can turn into whole day¡¯s gloomy thought in my head, which may be a general weakness of human being and I must be warily conscious about. After this gloomy thought led to bad result, what I can do is just to punish myself, which can make me a little comfortable. After I said breaking up to my love, it is exactly what I did. I just didn¡¯t want to eat, walked alone whole night and endured the stomachache caused by hungry. But I forgot about the other¡¯ feeling: heart breaking and worrying about my safety. She found me whole worldly in darkness. What she cares about is not her loosing a boyfriend in this cold night, but the safety and happiness of me. If I, she said, met accidence, she would never forgive herself and whether we would be together seemed not important at all. She only cares about me.
This emotion, no matter what it is called, love or whatever else, is unique in my life. Compare with it, the emotion I care about is only sadness of my self caused by something trivial of daily life. Yeah, I am such a jerk who hurt the heart of an angel, almost lost her and neglected the pure care of her. I will use my life to treasure it. I would never hurt it again and were willing to die for protecting it. This emotion I wish everyone can get it in his or her life, hold it tightly and never let it go. It, I think, is one of the most precious things in life. 














It has been almost several years for me to lie on the ground to watch the moving white clouds in the pure blue sky. In my opinion, the most difficult thing to draw down on paper is clouds in sky, coz it has no shape, its light and dark is beyond the human imagination and it is transforming all the time if you stare at them for a little while. In my childhood, the most fantastic thing in nature is cloud. It can intrigue your imagination, with which you can tell a story happened in heaven from this blue and white painting on the sky. It is just amazing!









Today, I took examination for admission to doctorate student of CNU. In English exam, I wrote a long article in my own words, which might not be so elegant but proper to express my ideas. I didn¡¯t use some big words, which I used to write an exam composition in past several years, and I found my vocabulary still not enough for a professional thesis and expression necessary to be improved. After all, I have written my own blogs for just several days and I believe that I will be fluent in expression with my daily writing habit. I start to feel like reading and writing in English. It is a way of leading a life, a way of doing science.
The examination of Differential Geometry is interesting, coz it has been a long time to do exercises in differential geometry. I had fun in solving the problems, and felt pleasant to write them concisely down on paper. It is just simple and beautiful. The only challenge is the last problem: to solve a geodesic equation from a given metric, which is conformal to Euclidean metric. I have got the connection coefficients and the geodesic differential equation, but I didn¡¯t know how to solve this equation. I guess it might be a line, coz its initial direction is parallel to the direction in which metric is always Euclidean metric. But the species solution I guess doesn¡¯t satisfying the equation, and yet I have no time to continue guessing.
Doing math problem needs acute thinking, some more imagination, and quickly calculating. It is funny.












Examination of Mathematical physics recalls me the experience in elementary school, when I always compete to get perfect in math exam. I hope I can get excellent result in this exam.
After the exam of application for admission to doctorate student of CNU, my friends and I went to Tiananmen Square to visit the renewed national museum of China. But we were not lucky, the museum closed when we arriving there. Therefore, we flied kite at Tiananmen Square. It was just as what I had imagined. Clear blue sky with few white clouds flowing away made my colorful kite most beautiful flying freely with warm wind of spring. Then something we didn¡¯t want came. A young safe guard of Square came to me, politely telling me that it is not allowed to fly kite at Square. I didn¡¯t willing to stop. I didn¡¯t feel democracy and freedom at this centre of this country. Coz I had fulfilled my dream of flying kite at Tiananmen Square, I rolled back the kite thread and packed the kite in my bag. I already felt pleasant to play and take photographs at the Square with my friends. I hope I can fly kites freely at Tiananmen Square one day.











We had dinner together with Professor Zhao. It is interesting to hear the past story of his graduate school day, when life is not easy, they had big appetite for meat and ate all meals up when go out for conference following Professor Wu. He also had a joke about raising children in Chinese culture, he said to raise up a boy means to operate a construction bank, while to cultivate a girl means to operate a commercial bank. Coz in Chinese culture, bridegroom should pay large mount of money to build a house and furniture for life after marriage, while bride doesn¡¯t afford too much. He also said the condition to entering a college to get a job for education or research was more and more rigor, which means I should set up a higher goal to fulfill my dream.











Today, my friend will return his hometown in Qinghai, and I will see him off. This friend taught me something how to treat people and friends around you. He was so kind that he cared about people around him, only wanted to give and thank people helped him no matter what price he would pay. He is just like a sun in the blue sky, I just feel warm when together with him. I wish he could learn more English and pass the entering exam for CNU.
We has a lunch with Mrs. Li just now and I feel pleasant to know this kind teacher.
After long determination, I finally buy one train ticket for berth to Hefei on April 3, which the tickets seller tought would have sold up and reply me very impationtly. 
Where there is a will, there is a way!










One sentence: practice random kindness and senseless acts of beauty.
My feeling about learning English: Browsing the book is a method for you to learn or find sth beyond the language, but to cultivate your sense of language using, you should slow down to chew the sentence and taste the word, especially when you read a poetry or prose like ¡°chicken soup for heart and soul¡±, then you will gain the long left feeling of pleasant and warm after fluently expressing the words from bottom of heart.
I wish this feeling can company my heart into good dream!










I feel like I should write something about my profile picture. It was taken during the 2006-2007 Christmas-New Year holidays in Chile. The photo was taken in a restaurant in Santiago (the capital) with live performance of singing and dancing. We also visited the southern part of the country and sailed across the Andes Mountains into Argentina. You might say,¡± Wait a minute, you sailed across the mountains? Yes, there are many lakes between the peaks of mountains and of course, part of the trip was in a bus. Anyway, I hope to share more photos with you in the future when I got permit to upload pictures. Chile is a very beautiful country and is perhaps the most developed in South America!
