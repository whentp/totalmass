As a prisoner at the Jixi labour camp, Liu Dali would slog through tough days breaking rocks and digging trenches in the open cast coalmines of north-east China. By night, he would slay demons, battle goblins and cast spells.

Liu says he was one of scores of prisoners forced to play online games to build up credits that prison guards would then trade for real money. The 54-year-old, a former prison guard who was jailed for three years in 2004 for "illegally petitioning" the central government about corruption in his hometown, reckons the operation was even more lucrative than the physical labour that prisoners were also forced to do.

"Prison bosses made more money forcing inmates to play games than they do forcing people to do manual labour," Liu told the Guardian. "There were 300 prisoners forced to play games. We worked 12-hour shifts in the camp. I heard them say they could earn 5,000-6,000rmb [¡ê470-570] a day. We didn't see any of the money. The computers were never turned off."

Memories from his detention at Jixi re-education-through-labour camp in Heilongjiang province from 2004 still haunt Liu. As well as backbreaking mining toil, he carved chopsticks and toothpicks out of planks of wood until his hands were raw and assembled car seat covers that the prison exported to South Korea and Japan. He was also made to memorise communist literature to pay off his debt to society.

But it was the forced online gaming that was the most surreal part of his imprisonment. The hard slog may have been virtual, but the punishment for falling behind was real.

"If I couldn't complete my work quota, they would punish me physically. They would make me stand with my hands raised in the air and after I returned to my dormitory they would beat me with plastic pipes. We kept playing until we could barely see things," he said.

It is known as "gold farming", the practice of building up credits and online value through the monotonous repetition of basic tasks in online games such as World of Warcraft. The trade in virtual assets is very real, and outside the control of the games' makers. Millions of gamers around the world are prepared to pay real money for such online credits, which they can use to progress in the online games.

The trading of virtual currencies in multiplayer games has become so rampant in China that it is increasingly difficult to regulate. In April, the Sichuan provincial government in central China launched a court case against a gamer who stole credits online worth about 3000rmb.

The lack of regulations has meant that even prisoners can be exploited in this virtual world for profit.

According to figures from the China Internet Centre, nearly ¡ê1.2bn of make- believe currencies were traded in China in 2008 and the number of gamers who play to earn and trade credits are on the rise.

It is estimated that 80% of all gold farmers are in China and with the largest internet population in the world there are thought to be 100,000 full-time gold farmers in the country.

In 2009 the central government issued a directive defining how fictional currencies could be traded, making it illegal for businesses without licences to trade. But Liu, who was released from prison before 2009 believes that the practice of prisoners being forced to earn online currency in multiplayer games is still widespread.

"Many prisons across the north-east of China also forced inmates to play games. It must still be happening," he said.

"China is the factory of virtual goods," said Jin Ge, a researcher from the University of California San Diego who has been documenting the gold farming phenomenon in China. "You would see some exploitation where employers would make workers play 12 hours a day. They would have no rest through the year. These are not just problems for this industry but they are general social problems. The pay is better than what they would get for working in a factory. It's very different," said Jin.

"The buyers of virtual goods have mixed feelings ¡­ it saves them time buying online credits from China," said Jin.

The emergence of gold farming as a business in China ¨C whether in prisons or sweatshops could raise new questions over the exporting of goods real or virtual from the country.

"Prison labour is still very widespread ¨C it's just that goods travel a much more complex route to come to the US these days. And it is not illegal to export prison goods to Europe, said Nicole Kempton from the Laogai foundation, a Washington-based group which opposes the forced labour camp system in China.









Explosions at three sites near government buildings in an eastern Chinese city have damaged 10 cars and injured at least five people, state media has reported.

The cause of the near-simultaneous blasts on Thursday in Fuzhou, Jiangxi province, was being investigated, the Xinhua news agency said, but it cited a provincial government source saying a disgruntled farmer was most likely to blame.

The blasts shook the prosecutor's office, a government office and the district food and drug administration, Xinhua said. Most of the windows in the eight-storey prosecutor's office were shattered after the explosion less than 100m away, it added.

One villager, Zhang Weizhang, believed that a discontented local resident was to blame.

"There are plenty of people complaining about the government. They ignore complaints. They've ignored mine," said Zhang, who said he was in a dispute over forestry rights in Fuzhou's Linchuan district. "But nobody ordinary would do something like this. This isn't normal for here."

The Fuzhou government did not respond to calls seeking comment.

Fuzhou's Communist party boss, Gan Liangmiao, told officials in October that they must "firmly establish the idea that stability comes before all else and stability comes higher than anything else", the Fuzhou Daily said at the time.

Jiangxi province is home to many mines, which use explosives, and fireworks manufacturers. In past years, disgruntled Chinese citizens have set off explosions near buildings or on buses.

Such "sudden incidents", as China refers to them, underscore broader government worries about stability in the world's second-largest economy, with a widening gap between rich and poor and growing anger at corruption and over environmental issues.

Earlier this month, a petrol bomb set off by a disgruntled former employee at a rural bank in north-west China's Gansu province wounded 49 people.

In 2001, a string of explosions at workers' dormitories in the northern city of Shijiazhuang killed 108 people.

Chinese farmers have been at the centre of many incidents of unrest and protest, with anger frequently focused on land grabs to make way for infrastructure projects or commercial buildings.

Last year, three people set themselves on fire in a Jiangxi county, not far from Fuzhou, to try to stop officials forcing them out of their homes to make way for a bus station.








Less than three years since Indian conglomerate Tata bought the British car company for ¡ê1.1bn from Ford, it has boosted global sales by 26% to 244,000 vehicles in the year to the end of March. The latest profits compared to a surplus of just ¡ê32m chalked up in 2009/10 when much of the world was mired in recession.

Analysts said JLR was achieving higher margins and selling more expensive models, as well managing its costs more efficiently. It had benefited from favourable foreign exchange rates and the popularity of new marques such as the Jaguar XJ.

JLR, which sought government aid at the height of the financial crisis amid fears it could collapse, said demand was soaring from middle-class customers in Asia, South America and the Middle East.

The company, which has two factories in the Midlands and one in Liverpool, said it was in the throes of a massive expansion programme that will see it recruit another 1,000 engineers as it seeks to develop new models. More than 1,500 additional British staff have already been taken on to help with the launch of the Range Rover Evoque, which goes on sale in the autumn.

A JLR spokesman said: "We employ 17,000, but our UK payroll number should increase to 20,000 by 2013. We plan to spend ¡ê1bn a year over the next five years on production and development."

Asked on Sky News if he regretted selling the company to Tata in 2008, William Clay Ford, the head of Ford, said: "We had to focus on our brands. But we took their quality from worst in class to best in class." He claimed Ford's investment was now coming through for Tata, but he congratulated the Indian company on its figures.

The biggest growth for JLR was in China where it sold 70% more vehicles than in 2009/2010. But JLR's largest market remains Britain where Land Rover sales (42,000) were up 8% and the best selling brand was the Freelander (starting price: ¡ê36,000). However, strong overseas demand for Jaguars, Range Rovers and Land Rovers has made the company one of Britain's most important exporters.

Analysts said Jaguar and Land Rover were fast becoming "a trophy brand" for tens of millions of people in emerging markets and were becoming increasingly popular in continental Europe.

JLR's figures were welcome news for Tata whose boss Ratan Tata last week ran into controversy when he said British managers didn't work as hard as their Indian counterparts. He made his remarks on the same day as unions criticised Tata Steel, formerly Corus, for axing 1,500 jobs in Lincolnshire and Teesside. The group blamed weak demand and the cost of climate-change legislation.

In an interview, Tata said British managers weren't prepared to "go the extra mile," while those in India were working in a "warlike situation".

JLR, which lost around ¡ê280m in the first 10 months of Tata's ownership, reported growth of 49% in Germany, 68% in Russia and 61% in India where the group benefited from Tata's local knowledge.

Carl-Peter Forster, Tata Motors group chief executive, commented: "Jaguar Land Rover is now a strong, profitable and innovative competitor in the premium car industry. The company's significant contribution to Tata Motors' earnings reflects a commitment to excellence and dedicated teamwork at Jaguar Land Rover and this will deliver even more attractive models and technologies to customers worldwide."










Isabel Hilton urges British businesses to be more cautious in their dealings with Chinese corporations (Chinese shadows, 22 May). She correctly states that Britain has "one of the world's most open economies" ¨C a key reason for its success in attracting foreign direct investment, and the jobs and tax dollars that go with it. This was certainly a key attraction for our company and we are proud of the contribution we are making as part of our long-term investment in the UK.

However, in an effort to assign a political or strategic dimension to investments from private companies in China, Hilton fails to understand Chinese companies in general and Huawei in particular. She suggests "Huawei exemplifies the suspicion that dogs China's industrial and commercial giants around the world" because of the oft-repeated misunderstanding about Huawei's founder and chief executive, Ren Zhengfei. Yes, he was in the military early in his career, just like many other corporate leaders in the US, UK and across the globe. But his service ended nearly three decades ago and he has no ties to the military.

Hilton notes that "as a key operator in Chinese telecoms, [Huawei] has a close relationship with the government". Our relationship with the Chinese state is no different to what any major company has with the government in its headquarters country. Her statement about that relationship, in the context of her article ¨C which mentions that "every significant Chinese company has a shadow party structure inside it" ¨C makes a commonly held practice in most countries come across as unseemly, which it isn't.

Let's be clear, the Chinese government has no ownership stake whatsoever in our company. Huawei is entirely profit-, not politically, motivated. And, if we had a "shadow party structure" guiding our company, it is highly unlikely that we would be partners with 45 of the world's top 50 telecom operators who clearly have no questions about the quality of our technology and our commitment to the highest standards of business practices.

Hilton also incorrectly states that "Huawei's corporate structure is opaque". All you have to do is look at our 2010 annual report for a very clear overview of that structure, including the company's organisational structure, biographies and photos of the board of directors, and a description of our shareholding scheme ¨C to name a few examples. Opaque we are certainly not.

If anything is opaque, it is the lens that some commentators use to measure companies like ours who have no motive other than continuing to bring our industry-leading communications technology to the United Kingdom, while also succeeding on a level playing field in a very competitive global business environment.

Those commentators have not produced one shred of evidence to support their insinuations, and I can assure you, in the case of Huawei, they never will.












So, Barack Obama is two-timing us Brits again. Only last Wednesday he was shamelessly flattering us as if we were his favourite auntie. No cliche about Anglo-American relationships was too corny to be overlooked; our relationship was more than just "special", it was "essential". Just how special is that?

But that was days ago. Next came France, for the G8 summit, and he had other people to butter up. Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, for example. Obviously Obama couldn't bang on about shared values and the rule of law because the Kremlin has been a consistent source of autocratic rule since Moscow princes got ideas above their station and started calling themselves Caesar ¨C or czar. But "outstanding" ¨C as the Russian-American relationship was characterised ¨C that's a suitably ambiguous adjective. And for the visit to Ireland, the White House lexicon came up with the "enduring" relationship, which is certainly true genetically ¨C given the ever-expanding number of Americans who claim to be Irish.But who are we to complain? It's a big world and everyone wants a White House adjective to copyright. How about a few more?

? The on-off relationship That would be France. It helped the US win independence from You Know Who but has been rescued so often since then that it needs to show ingratitude. Being shorter than De Gaulle, Sarko is sucking up. It won't last.

? The open relationship That must be Canada. Nuff said.

? The failed relationship Mexico, perhaps, after the drugs and migrant battles. "Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the US," as one Mexican dictator put it.

? The loving relationship If it can't be Ireland, it must be Italy, which has better food.

? The long-distance relationship That one must be China. It's a long way across the Pacific ¨C and the Sino-US relationship is going to go the distance. In fact, it is likely to be the key relationship of the 21st century, which may make the rest of us fearful that it doesn't turn into the ugly relationship. A lot of folk could get hurt.











A communist official tipped as a future leader of China is moving to defuse a wave of protests in Inner Mongolia by choking information, tightening campus controls and promising to reform the mining industry.

A demonstration by ethnic Mongolians on Monday in the regional capital, Hohhot, was the latest test for Hu Chunhua, whose appointment as party chief of the resource-rich region last year was widely seen as a step towards top office in 2020.

Censors have blocked information about the biggest surge of unrest that the northern region has experienced in 20 years, with witnesses and rights groups claiming to have seen rallies in at least six communities over the past week.

The protests were sparked by the killing of a Mongolian herder who tried to stop a convoy of coal trucks from trespassing on the grasslands. The case has become a symbol of unease about economic development that is marginalising ethnic rights and the steppe environment.

Locals told the Guardian the latest protests took place on Mondayin Hohhot despite tightened security. "It was about 20 Mongolians in Xinhua Square," said a blogger, who goes under the name Blue Sky Pigeon. "But I doubt it will last long because the controls are tight."

An employee at a hotel on the square confirmed a demonstration was taking place, but it was unclear how the security forces responded. The local police, government and propaganda offices either refused to comment or let phones ring unanswered, but the authorities have been working for several days to quash dissent with a mix of restrictions and conciliatory gestures.

After 1,000 students took to the streets in Xilinhot last Wednesday, paramilitary police are reportedly stationed at the gates of Inner Mongolia University in Hohhot and checking the identities and intentions of everyone going in and out. In other areas, schools associated with both Mongolian and Han ethnic groups have been subject to restrictions.

The Youth League Committee of Inner Mongolia University declined to discuss the new security measures, but acknowledged the students' online bulletin board and chatroom ¨C known as Qizhi ¨C had been shut down for "maintenance" until 10 June. Other reports suggest popular social networking sites such as QQ, Weibo and Tencent have been either blocked or heavily censored. A Chinese language internet search for "Inner Mongolia" and "protest" yielded no mention of the events of the past week.

Hotels near universities and schools have been forbidden from accepting foreign guests since last Friday. "The security has become tougher," said a taxi driver in Xilinhot, the site of an earlier disturbance.

Hu ¨C a protege of president Hu Jintao (though no relation) ¨C has tried to pacify the protesters with a promise of justice for the perpetrators of the killing of the herder ¨C known as Mergen ¨C on 11 June, and another death related to a coalmine protest four days later.

Recent incidents "have triggered a great deal of public anger", Hu told teachers and students last week, according to the Inner Mongolian Daily. "We will firmly protect the dignity of law and the rights of the victims and their families."

Local TV stations, which are controlled by the communist party, have shown Hu's deputy visiting Mergen's family to present a bundle of money. The chairman of the coal trucking company Liaoning Chuncheng Industry has also made a public apology. Police have arrested four people.

The official Xinhua News Agency said regional authorities would investigate the mining industry's impact on the environment and traditional livelihoods with the aim of improving the protection of grasslands. But many locals remain suspicious. Mongolian independence activists said concilliatory words could not disguise the long-term trends of resource exploitation that prompted the fatal clash between truckers and herders.

"Mongols have good reasons to doubt the intentions of the government. For the past six decades, the destruction of the grassland ecology, cultural assimilation, political oppression and economic exploitation have characterised the policies of the Chinese government in southern Mongolia," said a group calling itself the "Co-ordinating Committee for May 29/30 Protest".

If the protests continue, "Little Hu" (as the Inner Mongolian governor is nicknamed) may rely more on coercion and intimidation to impose order on a restless ethnic minority. There are precedents, including the crackdown imposed in Tibet by the current president Hu Jintao in the 1980s.

Recent mobile phone messages from the Inner Mongolian authorities have warned that the police are ready to "intensify the crackdown", according to Reuters. Amnesty International has urged restraint and called on the authorities to "respect freedom of expression and assembly for protesters".

Monday's relatively small demonstration, however, suggests Hu's efforts to silence, intimidate and buy-off critics may be working.










Knights looking down from a castle provide a grand entrance to Malta's Playmobil theme park. Lifesize figures of a farmer and a pirate tower over children at the Playmobil farm where youngsters can ride pigs and a crocodile, "milk" a cow (it's only water) and ride narrow-waisted horses.

The original FunPark at the German toymaker's headquarters in Zirndorf in Bavaria is much bigger, but the Maltese version is popular. "There isn't much here [in Malta] for children," says Noel Zarb, a salesman at Playmobil Malta. He says local children come every day.

A 45-minute tour of the adjacent Playmobil factory (¡ê7 including FunPark entry), the company's second-largest, is also a highlight. Children discover how the seven parts of a 7.5cm Playmobil figure, with its ever-smiling face, are made from tiny plastic granules and put together to form princesses, pirates, police officers and secret agents.

In Malta, Playmobil makes 2m of the tiny precision-moulded figures every week ¨C five times the island state's total full-size population.

At a time when 80% of the world's toys are made in China, Playmobil has stubbornly resisted pressure to shift production to the far east. Helga Ellul, the head of Playmobil Malta, says the company looked at it eight years ago but found that the cost advantage was not that big, partly because its main export markets are in Europe. Since then, Chinese wages have risen.

Playmobil is also anxious to retain control over quality. The company's owner, Horst Brandst?tter, once told his workers: "If we wanted to produce in China, I would have to clone you all."

The toymaker only produces a few electronic parts in China, for example for the new Top Agents series and the flashing light atop its police car. Its Danish arch-rival Lego ¨C the top toy brand in Germany, which has relegated Playmobil to second place ¨C is also largely manufactured in Europe, although it has moved more production to the far east than Playmobil.

The plastic figures owe their existence to the 1970s oil crisis. The family-owned parent company, which started out making toy telephones and brought the hula hoop to Europe, asked its head designer, (then called 'sample maker') Hans Beck, to come up with a smaller toy to save on plastic. He sketched out a short figure with a smiling face, but dropped the nose after children told him it looked like a clown. Initially the legs could be moved separately, but he found that made the figure unstable and opted for legs that only move in tandem.

"At the time we only had big dolls and tin soldiers," recalls Ellul. "Mr Beck's idea was to create a small world for children, a replica of what they live in. None of us, not even Mr Brandst?tter, knew the power of this toy at that time."

The basic design has not changed since then and today's accessories are compatible with the original figures. Production started in Malta in 1974, where the unemployment rate was 20%, whereas Germany had close to full employment. Maltese wages were only a 10th of those in Germany (they have now risen to between a third and a half). The Maltese government lured foreign companies with tax breaks and paid for the building of the Playmobil factory. Today Playmobil employs 900 people in Malta ¨C the second-largest employer after ST Microelectronics.

The ever-expanding Playmobil world scores highly on gender equality - there are female firefighters, police officers and vets ¨C but does less well on multiculturalism ¨C there aren't many non-white characters.

It regards itself as a predominantly European brand. "It is very much a toy that appeals to the European culture," says Ellul. "We are in the US and Canada but feel it is much more difficult to get our message across."

Britain also falls into this camp: its children are seen as less keen on role-playing than those on the continent and regarded as having a shorter attention span. "Too many video games, children being left alone at home in front of the telly, both parents working," says the UK commercial director, Graham Brennan.

"There is a huge difference between the social sectors in the UK. In Europe it's more evenly paced. And French children love collecting." France is Playmobil's biggest export market.

Even though the UK is a small part of Playmobil ¨C it generated sales of just ¡ê20m last year out of a group total of 507m (¡ê439m) ¨C there are plans to open a theme park in the south-west within the next five years. "It's a question of when ¨C not if," says Brennan. Sometimes Playmobil is a little too close to life. Brennan recalls a barrage of complaints when Playmobil produced a female figure bottle-feeding a baby in a hospital. "People complained saying you are telling young girls not to breast-feed," he says. "I pointed out to them that it is just a toy."

Some 24,000 tonnes of plastic go into making Playmobil toys every year. Pellets of clear plastic are mixed with coloured granules, heated up and injected into moulds. The machines spit out 32 heads every 20 seconds, still hot. The eyes and mouth are injected from inside the face rather than printed on so they don't rub off. Some 46 km of overhead pipes ferry the plastic around the Maltese factory.

The whole process is automated, except for the bagging and boxing at the end, and takes about five minutes. One giant machine assembles the figures part by part ¨C a 'skeleton' holds everything together ¨C and cameras monitor every move. If a figure is found to have a part missing, it is despatched into a bin. More complex characters such as Santa Claus are assembled by hand.

Unlike other toymakers, Brandst?tter, 78, who wants to hand over the company to a foundation when he retires, has resisted TV or film tie-ins. Despite the success of Lego's Star Wars computer game, he is not interested in licensed toys, saying they get in the way of imaginative play. "Playmobil could easily do Harry Potter but licences are expensive," says Bernhard Hane, head of research and development.

But there are some signs that Playmobil, which has seen its target age group slipping from four to 10 to four to eight, is starting to move with the times. This year's Top Agents range, featuring a remote-controlled car with a video camera, is a nod to the popularity of hi-tech toys. But it's not all about gadgets. A Playmobil bestseller in the UK is the swimming pool with water slide. "The pool is selling exceptionally well. I think it's the guy with the Speedos!" says Brennan.








The late JG Ballard once told the Guardian that in cyberspace "the entire human experience seems to unveil itself like the surface of a new planet". Whenever we log on we carry our essential human nature with us. Like people, cyberspace has a dark side and it is already shaping our future security environment. The openness of our society, our connectedness with the wider world and our hi-tech way of life is a source of strength. But openness also brings vulnerability.

Threats do not just come from malicious viruses or organised criminals stealing people's identity or money. Digital networks are now at the heart of our transport, power and communications systems, and our economy as a whole. This reliance brings the capacity for warfare to cyberspace. The consequences of a well-planned, well-executed attack against our digital infrastructure could be catastrophic. In this way, a single networked laptop might be as effective a weapon as, say, a cruise missile.

The national security strategy identifies cyber-attack in the top tier of risks to the UK over the next five years. An extra ¡ê650m has now been allocated to create a national cyber security programme to fund work across government in partnership with business and other experts to strengthen our understanding, our resilience and our defences.

Understanding is key. In the military sphere, whenever a new domain opens up, like air and space flight in the last century, the temptation is to devise wholly separate doctrines to address the new environment. But we must remember that cyber crime, cyber terrorism, cyber espionage, or cyber war are simply crime, terrorism, espionage or war by other means. Cyberspace adds a new dimension, but its use in warfare should be subject to the same strategic and tactical thought as existing means. Action in cyberspace will form part of the future battlefield, but it will be integrated rather than separate, complementary rather than alternative. Suggestions that cyber weapons will replace traditional weaponry are fanciful to say the least. Cyber will be part of a continuum of tools with which to achieve military effect, both defensive and otherwise, and will be an integral part of our armoury. That is why the MoD has created a new cyber operations group under the command of General Jonathan Shaw to mainstream cyber across the whole spectrum of defence operations and to ensure that the same framework of command and control that exists for traditional operations exists for cyber too. This will link into work being taken forward across Government to ensure a comprehensive approach.

We need to be comprehensive, because cyberspace has specific characteristics that blur traditional boundaries. First, the technology is similar to that used by people going about their daily business. With nuclear or biological weapons, the technical threshold is high. With cyber, the finger hovering over the button could be anyone from a state to a student. Second, establishing who is behind any attack and its purpose is difficult, particularly where aggressive state-sponsored activity is undertaken through proxies. Third, there are no geographic barriers in cyberspace.An attack could originate from anywhere.

This is why, as Britain reinvigorates its national cyber security architecture, we need to do the same internationally. In an environment of cyber anarchy Britain would be more vulnerable. Cyber space should be considered within a rules based system just like the physical world. Existing international frameworks can be applied to cyber space too ¨C we don't necessarily need to invent new laws.Top of the list of the UK principles on activity in cyber space is the need for governments to act proportionately and in accordance with national and international law. These principles should apply in the civilian and military sphere alike. There is a lot of work being done bi-laterally and multilaterally to develop common understanding and common positions. But this work needs to be guided by discussion of how states should act in cyber space.

Some argue that the difficulties involved in detecting and attributing cyber activity mean any international consensus would be worthless so why bother trying? Others argue that the west has a technological advantage and shouldn't tie itself down to multilateral policy. I disagree.

First, a new international consensus won't extinguish threats but it will help manage them. Consensus would provide legitimacy for action.

At the very least, dialogue seeking to reach a common understanding about how states should behave would crystallise where we have significant problems or form the basis for building trust, confidence and transparency. The conference which William Hague announced the UK will host later this year is an important step in this direction. Second, it is inevitable that the west's technological edge will be challenged as other countries, particularly China, rapidly develop modern economies, modern militaries and modern technologies. It would be foolish to assume the west can always dictate the pace and direction of cyber technology. We should act now to influence positively the evolution of behaviour in cyber space.

The bottom line is this. There is no point hiding behind national strategies or constructing a mythical Maginot line in cyberspace. We need to think and act internationally because cyberspace is international space and the rules that govern it will be international too.










Chinese authorities have proposed an unofficial payoff to a family bereaved by the military crackdown that followed the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests, according to a group representing the victims.

In a statement released just before the 22nd anniversary of the deadly crackdown on 4 June, the Tiananmen Mothers said security forces had privately approached one of their members to discuss an individual payoff.

But the member rejected the proposal ¨C discussed during two visits in February and April ¨C because it was secretive and made no mention of an investigation, apology or public accounting for what happened.

"This year, the silence was finally broken. This should have been welcome. But what in fact does this belated response mean?" asked the 127 members of the group who signed the statement. "The visitors did not speak of making the truth public, carrying out judicial investigations, or providing an explanation for the case of each victim. Instead, they only raised the question of how much to pay, emphasising that this was meant for that individual case and not for the families in the group as a whole."

The group said they had documented the cases of 203 people who were shot, beaten or crushed to death by People's Liberation Army tanks in the wake of the 1989 protests. Many other victims remained unidentified, they said.

The government tightly restricts discussion of the demonstrations ¨C which spread to several cities ¨C or the murderous crackdown that followed, except occasionally to justify the actions as necessary to prevent political turmoil.

Given the government's stance, direct public compensation for victims' families is highly unlikely, but several senior cadres have called for a re-evaluation of the protests and a recognition that the students and workers were not involved in a counter-revolutionary plot. There have been reports of unofficial payoffs.

In 2005, Tang Deying ¨C the mother of a student killed in police custody in Chengdu soon after the 1989 protests ¨C was given 70,000 yuan (¡ê6,850) in "hardship assistance" by local officials, according to a local activist, Huang Qi.

Overseas lawyers and human rights activists said the government's latest approach to the Tiananmen Mothers was unlikely to signal a change of policy.

"We know the communist party has tried to get people to remain silent on this issue by using carrots as well as sticks," said Nicholas Bequelin of Human Rights Watch. "I doubt that this will lead to acknowledgement of government responsibility, though the fact that the Tiananmen Mothers are not in jail is an unspoken recognition of the legitimacy of their case."

Others expressed surprised that the approach came while China is in the midst of the tightest clampdown on dissent since 1989.

"Why now?" asked Joshua Rosenzweig of the Dui Hua foundation, which supports political prisoners. "It seems an unlikely moment for the state ¨C even in this limited way ¨C to address this legacy."










It is designed to be the creative hub that catapults local film-makers towards the heights achieved by Hollywood animation giants such as Pixar and DreamWorks. China has opened a $4.5bn yuan (¡ê420m) facility in Tianjin, near Beijing, aimed at producing films that can compete with the best of the west.

More on this film
Chinese authorities say more than 180 firms will be present at the new 190-acre facility, which is located about 30 minutes from the capital via high-speed rail.

The move follows the opening of Hollywood's latest animated blockbuster, the Chinese-themed Kung Fu Panda II, in the US and China at the weekend. The first instalment broke box office records in China three years ago but was criticised in some quarters as western exploitation of Chinese culture. FHowever, many questioned why the DreamWorks film had not been made by a local company.

Chinese animated films have struggled internationally, but a forthcoming project, Legend of a Rabbit, appears to be a bid to redress the balance. Like the DreamWorks film, it features an anthropomorphic hero who learns kung fu, in this instance a lowly bunny who takes on a skilled panda to save a martial arts school. The $18m 3D project, which has been in development for three years with a team of more than 500 animators, is set for a June release in China.

It appears to be a reaction to a large degree of soul-searching in China following the success of Kung Fu Panda. After the film became the first animated movie to pass the 100m yuan mark at the box office, award-winning director Lu Chuan wrote an article in the state-run China Daily newspaper questioning why Chinese animated films were not able to compete.

"I cannot help wondering when China will be able to produce a movie of this calibre," he said, adding that he had tried to make an animated film for the 2008 Olympics but was forced to give up as a result of government interference.

"I kept receiving directions and orders on how the movie should be like," he wrote. "The fun and joy from doing something interesting left us, together with our imagination and creativity."

At Friday's opening ceremony for the new Tianjin facility, China's minister of culture, Cai Wu, said that production of animation films was part of a plan to develop the country's cultural industries before 2015.

Kung Fu Panda 2 opens in the UK on 10 June.








The attraction to the Chinese of access to an area of land in Patagonia larger than Cornwall is obvious. As China's economy grows and its population becomes more urbanised, diets are changing rapidly. People are eating more industrially produced meat and dairy products, and buying more processed foods.

Soya is the feedstock for this revolution, but demand for it can no longer be met within China. So the Chinese state-owned agribusiness company Beidahuang has joined the global scramble for land and water that has accelerated since food prices spiked in 2008.

Last year it was confirmed that the company had signed an agreement, with the government of Patagonia's R¨ªo Negro province, which provides the framework for it to acquire up to 320,000 hectares (790,000 acres) of privately owned farmland, along with irrigation rights and a concession on the San Antonio port.

Details of the deal, alleged to have been kept quiet, have been emerging in recent weeks as Chinese technicians have started work.

Beidahuang has also reported a 2008 deal on 200,000 ha in the Philippines, and says it plans to buy palm oil plantations and grain terminals this year as it pursues the Chinese government's policy of securing food supply lines from abroad.

Beidahuang, based in the north-eastern province of Heilongjiang, is the leading soya producer in China and one of the country's five largest soya processors. It also raises more than 600,000 cows, 1.3m pigs and more than 6m chickens at any one time.

The company believes its expertise in large-scale farming can be transferred to Argentina, according to Juan Manuel Accatino, the region's deputy secretary for agriculture in R¨ªo Negro, who was close to the deal. The arrangement made good economic sense, Accatino said. "We can foresee global shortages of land, water and energy, and R¨ªo Negro can offer all three."

Argentinian environmental groups and constitutional experts are outraged. Eduardo Barcesat is a top constitutional lawyer who has been helping the federal government of the Argentinian president, Cristina Kirchner, draft legislation that would restrict foreign ownership of Argentinian land. The laws would also provide, for the first time, a full register of all landholding so that authorities can keep track of who owns what.

"Chinese and Indian people have been coming to Argentina over the last five years and would be happy to buy all our land, whatever the price. American businesses have been buying access to our water," Barcesat said. "We need our own people to eat well first, and after that we can feed the rest of the world. We want more small and middle-sized owners, we don't like the excessive concentration, and we want farmers who will be careful with the land, not exploit it."

Research from the International Land Coalition, and Oxfam Novib, the Netherlands affiliate of Oxfam International, has identified more than 1,200 international land deals covering more than 80m hectares since 2000 ¨C the vast majority of them after 2007. More than 60% of the land targeted was in Africa.

The R¨ªo Negro region is famous for its fruit orchards, which produce 70% of the country's apples and pears, exports eaten in northern Europe when the fruit season in that continent ends.

Environmentalists in R¨ªo Negro say the Chinese arrival will mean heavy use of agrochemicals, ecological degradation and severe strain on the region's water resources. Some of the land in question is virgin forest that would be deforested.

Dams have already cut the flow of the Negro river, they say, and Chinese plans to invest $20m (¡ê12m) immediately to build irrigation infrastructure would strain resources further. The campaigners say that since soya cultivation is highly mechanised it will prompt unemployment in the area, as it has elsewhere in the country where many rural communities have seen an increase in deep poverty as jobs are lost.

Elvio Mendioroz, president of U?opat¨²n, an agro-ecoclogical group that opposes the Chinese deal, said the agreement had been kept secret. "China has run out of land to feed its people, and is suffering drought and soil erosion, so they come here.

"But it will create the same problems for us. There has been no consultation, yet it's already signed."

Accatino thinks the deal has been misunderstood. R¨ªo Negro's provincial government was merely acting as a facilitator for the Chinese, he said, who would have to negotiate with the private owners of land to buy sections. The port concession, reported as being for 50 years, would depend on an evaluation of its feasibility.

Accatino said: "We will take into account the environmental concern about further expansion of soya and dependency of this monoculture. We would never endanger the Negro river."

China is running out of cloud-seeding shells after pounding the skies with a massive barrage to ease the worst drought that parts of the Yangtze delta have experienced for more than 100 years.

One of the country's biggest manufacturers of the weather-modifying ordnance said its warehouses were empty despite raising production by 30%, operating on weekends and adding two hours to shift times.

Workers on the assembly lines of Jiangxi Gangsi encase catalytic chemicals ¨C usually silver iodide or liquid nitrogen ¨C in shells, which are fired by cannon or dropped from aircraft, to create water droplets in clouds that will fall as rain.

Since 2000, the company has played a key role in China's weather-modification programme, thought to be the world's biggest, with an annual budget of ¡ê65m and offices in 30 provinces.

It is one of the nation's biggest makers of cloud-seeding shells, but company managers told the Guardian that they have struggled to meet a surge of demand during an unusually hot, dry spring.

"There is demand but not enough supply. This year is special," said Gu Jiangjun, a sales manager. "We normally produce 3,000 shells a month but now we are aiming for 4,000 to 5,000."

Even for a country that is used to drought, this year's arid spell has been shocking because of its duration and location: the Yangtze region is usually considered one of the lushest in China.

But Asia's greatest river is shrinking and shallowing, along with many of the lakes around it.

Shanghai is in its longest dry spell for 138 years, according to People's Daily.

Further upstream, Hunan is suffering the worst drought since 1910, affecting water supplies for 1.1 million people and 157 urban areas.

Television bulletins and newspapers are filled with images of dead fish, stranded ships and dry river beds.

Hydropower production has been slashed and vast swaths of paddy fields are parched.

The Three Gorges dam has been forced to cut hydropower generation and open its sluice gates to provide more water to downstream areas.

Recent cloudbursts ¨C some precipitated by weather-modifying techniques ¨C have raised hopes that the rainy season may finally have arrived.

But the China Meteorological Administration forecasts a short, sharp ¨C and possibly dangerous ¨C flood season, amid a long, hot summer.

Agency officials encouraged local governments to make continued use of weather-modifying techniques.

"We attach great importance to artificial rainfall in the effort to ease the drought," said the administration's vice director, Chen Zhenlin.

Chinese scientists claim that cloud-seeding can increase precipitation in targeted areas by 10-15%.

However, production of the shells may be hindered by government price controls.

Each cloud-seeding shell costs about 1,000 yuan (¡ê94) ¨C a figure that has been set since 2000, which means there is little financial incentive to boost production.

"We proposed a price increase to our senior executives," said Gu. "They sent a team to investigate the cost-production capacity. But these things take time."








Tensions between the US, UK and China over the issue of cyber-attacks were set to escalate after it emerged that Chinese hackers have stolen the login details of hundreds of senior US and South Korean government officials as well as Chinese political activists.

Google said it had discovered and alerted hundreds of people who had been taken in by a carefully targeted "phishing" scam originating from Jinan, the capital of Shandong province. Hackers aimed to get complete control of users' email accounts on the Gmail system.

While there is no direct evidence that the hackers were in the pay of the Chinese government, the sophistication of the attacks and their highly targeted nature eliminates direct financial gain as a motive. Google did not rule out the possibility of the attack being state-sponsored.

The action could seriously heighten tensions over the issue of cyberwar. The US government moved this week to classify cyber-attacks as "acts of war", while the defence minister Nick Harvey said on Monday that "action in cyberspace will form part of the future battlefield".

At an international cybersecurity conference being held in London this week, delegates warned that new cyber-attacks were being developed so quickly that there should be a nonproliferation treaty over their creation and use.

Michael Rake of BT Group warned world powers were being drawn into a hi-tech arms race, with many already able to fight a war without firing a single shot.

"I don't think personally it's an exaggeration to say you can bring a state to its knees without any military action whatsoever," Rake said. He said it was "critical to try to move toward some sort of cyber technology non-proliferation treaty."

The Chinese government has repeatedly denied any involvement in hacking of foreign countries' systems.

The latest series of attacks appears to have been going on since February, according to a report referenced by Google. It said people using Google and Yahoo accounts were being targeted in a "spear phishing" campaign, in which emails crafted to be relevant only to the recipients are sent out with malware or fake links.

If the person opens the email or follows the links, they will be led to sites which will steal their email login details or silently redirect all their email to another address.

One example "spear phishing" email had the title "Fw: Draft US-China Joint Statement" and contained the text: "This is the latest version of State's joint statement. My understanding is that State put in placeholder econ language and am happy to have us fill in but in their rush to get a cleared version from the WH, they sent the attached to Mike."

"Google detected and has disrupted this campaign to take users' passwords and monitor their emails," a spokesman said. "We have notified victims and secured their accounts. In addition, we have notified relevant government authorities. We believe that this campaign to steal users' passwords originated from Jinan, China. We can't say for sure who is responsible."

Google said its own systems were not affected ¨C a contrast with the situation at the end of 2009 when government-sanctioned Chinese hackers broke into the Google systems and are thought to have gained access to highly sensitive codes.

At the same time, Chinese hackers attempted, sometimes successfully, to break into US companies, including Morgan Stanley, and global oil companies.

China is believed to have gained a hugely valuable set of data about US military systems from a US Aries II signals intelligence aircraft that was forced to land on Hainan Island in April 2001 following a midair collision with a Chinese fighter jet.

The White House said it was investigating the claims made by Google.

"We're looking into these reports and are seeking to gather the facts," said spokesman Tommy Vietor. "We have no reason to believe that any US government email accounts were accessed."

FBI spokeswoman Jenny Shearer said: "We are aware of Google's announcement regarding attempts to obtain passwords and gain access to these accounts. We are working with Google to review this matter."







 the world's biggest soft drinks manufacturer, is in talks with the Chinese authorities to list its shares on the Shanghai stock exchange. China experts say the move heralds a wave of Chinese listings as the world's biggest companies look to build their businesses in the world's most populous nation.

Foreign companies are not yet allowed to list in mainland China but the authorities are exploring the possibility of opening an international board and Atlanta-based Coca-Cola could be among the first western firms to sign up.

Geoff Walsh, Coca-Cola's communications director for the Asia-Pacific region, told the Hong Kong Economic Journal that the company is "exploring the opportunity of listing our stock on the Shanghai exchange". He said the company continues "to have positive discussions with Chinese government officials as we look at this opportunity".

John Quelch, dean of the China Europe International Business School in Shanghai, said: "Coca-Cola is an American icon. They will be the first of many and I expect the news will set off a wave of announcements about listings on Asian markets."

The move marks yet another dramatic shift in Coca-Cola's relationship with China. Although it set up bottling plants in Shanghai and Tianjin in 1927, it was kicked out by the communists in 1949 as a symbol of US imperialism. It returned in 1979 when China began its economic reforms.

The news follows announcements that three London-listed companies, HSBC, Unilever and Standard Chartered, are also planning to join the Shanghai exchange. China now has the world's third-biggest stock markets after the US and Japan.

Quelch said Coca-Cola's move was the latest signal in a wider shift in the world economy. "The percentage of the market cap of global companies that is currently held by US investors is going to decline. In 10 years' time, I'd predict that 20 companies in the Fortune 500 will have Asian chief executives."

Last year, Coca-Cola's chief executive, Muhtar Kent, said that the company intended to spend $2bn in China. The firm's Sprite brand is already the country's top selling soft drink. But competition is fierce from local brands Wahaha and Kangshifu and American arch-rival Pepsi, which has a deal with Yum Brands, owner of KFC and Pizza Hut.

China is Yum Brands's fastest growing market: the company opened 500 new restaurants there last year. It now has over 4,000 outlets including the local Little Sheep Mongolian barbecue chain.

Philip Gorham, an analyst at MorningStar, said a Shanghai listing would allow Coca-Cola to "tap into a fast growing investor market" and "allow Chinese investors to invest in a great company without the currency risk."

Gorham added that Coca-Cola was currently enjoying double-digit growth in China ¨C its third biggest market after the US and Mexico ¨C at a time when sales were close to flat across North America and Europe.

Overseas companies can list in Hong Kong but they are barred from doing so in mainland China. Chinese investors can only buy overseas-listed shares through special investment programmes.

Plans to allow the listing of foreign firms have been under discussion since 2007. But the financial crisis is believed to have delayed the authorities' plans to allow qualified foreign companies to issue yuan-denominated stocks.

Chinese media have recently reported that the government may approve the listing of overseas companies on the mainland by the end of June and the first listing on that board may happen as soon as October.








Imagine a label, one that reads: "An actual, living, breathing human used their own hands to help make this product." This is just what the (western) world needs, a label affixed to consumer goods. We need this urgent reminder because in those seconds when we decide to purchase another piece of life's apparatus we are strikingly effective at suppressing any ethical doubt over its provenance.

The first thing we do (with varying levels of awareness) is convince ourselves that ¨C from the hottest bits of sleek hi-tech gadgetry to highly embellished fashion garments ¨C these were made by very clever robot arms that can apply toxic chemicals to a touch screen or expertly sew a sequin or bead. But as today's Observer report on Apple products lays bare, our consumer goods still arrive courtesy of the blood, sweat and tears of many human beings.

The Global Assembly Line is a misnomer for a dystopian, complex jumble of production that uses any number of countries and its citizens. Environmentalists are already aware that the price tag on most mass global consumer products already fails to factor in the true ecological cost ("natural capital") of the product.

From elements in mobile phones to leather in trainers, all are habitually "subsidised" by the environment. Furthermore, with electronics, ethical arguments have tended to focus on the end of the chain, where consumer behaviour conspires with Moore's Law (the amount of computing power that can be bought for a certain amount of money doubles every 18 months) and planned obsolescence to create mountains of e-waste.

But today's report reveals the human capital that is also squandered. No supply chain so dependent on workers should be breathtakingly intolerant of any of their needs. What's more, and to put it bluntly, it is hard to find any robot (given research and development costs and maintenance) which matches humans working on the global supply chain on a pure cost basis. In this sense, humans are very "cheap".

It's now over 100 years on from the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in New York, which killed 149 workers in the garment district and led to better labour laws, but still workers in the developing world are dying in similar incidents. However, the "quirks" within a global assembly line which make worker suffering at best likely and at worst inevitable are beginning to receive more attention.

The habitual use of unpaid, enforced overtime is common across many sectors. In the fashion industry, garment workers are effectively set up to fail. When a multinational places an order at the behest of a buyer the workers are set quotas to meet the order. Professor Doug Miller, an expert on the garment supply chain and workers' rights, has identified a discrepancy between the estimated and real time taken for a garment worker to complete an order. So the multinational buyer's calculations are based on standard minute values (SMVs) ¨C virtual minutes based on a factory that operates at near 100% efficiency.

However, in countries such as Cambodia (the British high street is heavily reliant on Cambodian production), the efficiency of factories rarely rises above 30%. Garment workers can therefore work flat out without any hope of meeting their targets within their paid working hours. At this point, they are forced to work overtime and sometimes gates may be shut or locked (including the fire escapes).

In the world of consumer electronics, the pressure to work overtime appears to have been caused by the sheer popularity of new products. Whipped into a frenzy by marketing and favourable product reviews, we consumers shriek for the latest gadgetry and the factories must oblige.

It's worth reading the testimonies that tell us what life as a "techno-serf" is really like. A clue: it's totally at odds with the liberating, blue-sky, wireless possibilities offered by the sleek phones and laptops. The words: "Twelve hours of work = standard" and: "One year and I'm dead" were recently found in the notebook of a young man who had been working for a famous electronics brand in South Chungcheong province before he took his own life. We are beginning to hear of intense worker despondency and depression. It's really about time we listened. These stories help to blunt the usual retorts of: "It gives them jobs" or: "They are just having their industrial revolution now." They also remind us that this is a battle for human decency and that if the price of a product is to condemn fellow humans to grab a few hours sleep cheek by jowl in a concrete dormitory for a pittance, that is surely too high a price.

As consumers, we still tend to be most receptive to the voices of brand spokespeople. Time after time, we trust their soothing words: "We're working on these challenges", "We've been let down badly by a supplier", "These are not our values" etc and placated by their corporate social responsibility reports. Robert Reich warns in his recent book, Supercapitalism, corporate social responsibility is "as meaningful as cotton candy".

But Reich's ultimate position is that we should stop expecting corporations to do the right thing. And I can't see any way of absolving the consumer of responsibility. I used to advocate going through a sort of consumerist catechism before making any consumer purchasing decision. Who made this product? Why did they make it? Why do I need it? I feel as if I urgently need to return to this way of buying. An understanding of the provenance of the product is key.

Given the global supply chain's scattergun approach to production, this means that product labels revealing even an outline of the origins of an average possession would need to be as long as cows' tongues. A small price to pay. Too much information is currently hushed up while multinationals cite competitive confidentiality as the reason for lack of transparency. Neither should we be put off the scent as consumers by the greening of companies and brands. It is far easier for multinationals to be green than address labour rights. But environmental and social justice must go together.

It has to be said that we don't help ourselves as consumers. Sometimes, the aesthetics and cool of a product eclipse the ethics so thoroughly that we are pathetically seduced.

As you probably suspect, I'm typing this on a MacBook Air. US writer Wendell Berry says: "The global economy institutionalises a global ignorance, in which producers and consumers cannot know or care about one another, and in which the histories of all products will be lost. In such a circumstance, the degradation of products and places, producers and consumers is inevitable." Yes, these products make hypocrites of us all.









Another day, another wobble in the commodity markets. Just "froth" being blown off, says Ivan Glasenberg, chief executive of the commodities trader Glencore. That's his opinion, and maybe he would be relaxed even if he didn't have a ¡ê36bn flotation to sell.

Nor is he alone in citing "froth"¨C it's the standard explanation when nobody has a better one to explain why the oil price plunged by 10% one day last week. It's also true that little sell-off in commodities was a brief affair ¨C it was over by the afternoon. But surely there's something more happening beyond the usual rough and tumble in markets awash with speculative money? Surely there's something fundamental taking place?

The thinktank Capital Economics has put its finger on one possible fundamental factor. Demand from China for commodities, it explains, is likely to fall well short of what markets currently appear to expect. Hold on, bulls might object, aren't China's imports growing rapidly despite the authorities' efforts to control inflation by raising reserve requirements for its banks? Isn't that what the data says?

Look closer, Capital Economics says: the value of China's imports is still growing rapidly but that reflects higher year-on-year global prices for commodities; the volume data, on the other hand, indicates falls, especially in copper and aluminium.

It's an important point, especially if China's growth rate now slows further.







The allegations against Dominique Strauss-Kahn have highlighted some of the worst facets of British journalism. Some newspapers have simply ignored the story, presumably on the grounds that the International Monetary Fund is a faraway body of which we know little, while the former broadsheets have tended to revel in the mix of high finance and "high jinks", even though the incident involves a charge of a serious sexual crime.

The background coverage of the role of the IMF is equally unedifying, with the televised detention of the IMF chief seemingly just an interruption to the process of agreeing another bailout for Greece. The IMF was holding its latest biannual meeting with representatives of 187 countries, which registered further snail-like towards recognising the shifting economic balance of power in the world economy.

The fund had previously agreed to double its capital (or quotas) to $756bn, and a series of fast-growing countries led by China and India are increasing their quota to partially reflect their increased weight in the world economy. This is at the expense of the much slower economies of the old G7 grouping, including the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, who see their quota and voting power reduced.

There has also been a gradual breakdown in the so-called Washington Consensus, which was supported by the IMF, the World Bank and the US treasury department. This has been a crusading ideology, championing an end to capital controls and in favour of lower state spending, privatisations and reduced pay and living standards to bolster competition.

The repeated and disastrous failures of these policies in Africa, Asia and Latin America did little to dent the ideology until the costly default of Argentina in 2002. As the whole preceding period had been an exercise in implementing Washington Consensus economics, there was nobody else to blame when it failed so spectacularly and drove Argentina into bankruptcy.

This was echoed in the recent crisis in all the western economies. Not only did the IMF fail to foresee the biggest economic crisis since the depression of the 1930s, but also its own shibboleths of deregulation, free movement of capital and reduced taxes and government spending contributed to it.

Temporarily, at least, most western governments abandoned these failed nostrums simply to avert economic catastrophe. The IMF has shifted uncomfortably to adapt to the new situation, even boasting in one recent publication that "we have worked closely with governments to protect and even extend social spending".

Elsewhere, authoritative IMF research has shown both how counterproductive government spending cuts will be and how increased government investment provides the answer to the economic crisis.

Now that the mood in the G7 has swung back in favour of lower state spending, privatisations and reduced pay this new thinking may not last. In any event, IMF-style impositions have come to western Europe (with the fund itself the junior partner to the EU) with predictable results. Growth forecasts are being slashed for Portugal, Greece and Ireland, and in Britain too ¨C there being no need for the IMF when you have a Tory-led government.

But these are failed and backward-looking policies. We have been living in exceptional times. For most of recorded history, until the end of the 19th century, China and India were far bigger economies than any in western Europe or the US. Their rapid growth over recent decades means the world economy is tilting back towards its usual axis. The composition, voting rights and leadership of the IMF should reflect that. Given the scintillating growth of the Chinese and Indian economies, we would all do well to learn from a new Indian or Chinese head of the IMF.









It was reported this week that China's sovereign wealth fund is about to receive new capital from the government, adding billions of dollars annually to its already impressive wallet. As China's economic power continues to grow and countries around the world compete for Chinese investment, the question facing developed countries is not so much what happens when China rules the world, as what will be the impact when China owns the world?

The China Investment Corporation was set up in 2007 to invest some of the $3tn in foreign exchange reserves that have accumulated through trade surpluses ¨C fuelled in part, critics would say, by an artificially depressed exchange rate. It is currently the world's fourth largest sovereign wealth fund but is growing fast as the Chinese government pursues its twin goals of securing raw materials and energy, and reducing its holdings of US treasury bonds ¨C no longer seen by Beijing as future-proof.

Until 2000 China's investments outside Asia were small and largely aimed at energy and natural resources in Latin America and Africa. But now China is on a spending spree, buying into mining interests from Australia to Canada and looking for acquisitions that might give them technology, major brands or market access.

In addition a host of other Chinese companies have moved into Europe and the US. Luxury textiles and vineyards in Italy, electronics manufacturers in France, engineering in Germany and car manufacturers in Britain are only some of China's purchases. All are harmless enough; but as the writer Richard McGregor describes in his recent book on the Chinese Communist party, every significant Chinese company has a shadow party structure inside it. Before we sell the entire farm, should we not be clearer about who exactly is buying it?

Britain, one of the world's most open economies, has assiduously courted Chinese investment and now boasts more than 400 Chinese companies and 40% of Chinese inward investment to Europe. China is still a relatively small investor in the US and in Europe, but as both struggle to escape recession, the increasing pace of Chinese deals makes McGregor's question more salient: should China be regarded as just another country?

Right now, politicians and officials are tiptoeing towards a decision on the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei's offer of discounted mobile telephony for the London underground. The deal is described as "sensitive" in official circles, because Huawei exemplifies the suspicion that dogs China's industrial and commercial giants around the world. Ren Zhengfei, who founded the company in 1988, is a former People's Liberation Army officer, Huawei's corporate structure is opaque, and, as a key operator in Chinese telecoms, it has a close relationship with the government.

In the US, three Huawei deals have been blocked by the US committee on foreign investment. Huawei's opponents insist that ties to the PLA remain, despite company denials. China's policy of owning 50% of any "pillar" industry is enough to ensure continuing hostile scrutiny. And the US is not alone. In 2009, Australia, which has extremely close economic ties to China, invoked national security to disallow China's Minmetals group's attempted $1.8bn purchase of OZ Minerals on the grounds that the key asset ¨C the Prominent Hill mine ¨C was close to the Woomera weapons testing range.

China itself bans foreign investment in any military or national security sector and restricts it in other key areas: this has killed off some steel and construction sector deals and, bizarrely, Coca-Cola's bid for China's biggest juice maker. In February China set up its own mechanism for scrutinising foreign bids under national security rules. Britain has no similar mechanism. Perhaps it should learn from the Chinese.








Visiting Beijing's now-disbanded Shouwang church late last summer, I struggled to secure a seat. For an "underground" church it was very rowdy. Housed in a bland conference room at a state-run television studio, the church was crammed with some 300 people scrabbling for foldaway chairs. In the corner, a Yamaha keyboard accompanied a lilac-robed choir. When the pastor took to the stage the congregation burst into hymn with a gusto only surpassed by the rocking, whispered prayers that came after.

Seven weeks ago that congregation was scattered by government officials. On Monday, when Shouwang attempted to hold an outdoor service, 27 people were detained, including a woman in her 80s and a two-year-old child, according to a witness. It's been the same story for the last seven Sundays, with several hundred detained in total and six church leaders placed under house arrest. The crackdown is seen as part of a larger tightening of state control since the Middle East unrest. Google continues to be tinkered with and Ai Weiwei has all but disappeared.

In China, a country studded with Buddha statues not crucifixes, Christianity has been secretly blooming. Though Protestantism is one of China's five officially recognised religions (along with Buddhism, Taoism, Islam and Catholicism), the vast majority of Christians choose to be members of "house" churches, technically illegal gatherings with evangelical leanings, that take place in people's homes, town halls and empty restaurants.

Founded in 1993 in a home by a small group of believers, Shouwang's congregation now numbers over 1,000. On my visit, a member explained why worshippers preferred the house churches: "They take Christ as the head of the church, with the bible as the only moral standard. The state-run church is very much influenced by politics."

The rate of conversion to Christianity in China is staggering. There were about 2 million Christians 30 years ago. Today there are between 23.5 million (the official statistic taken from state-run churches) and 130 million (including house churches) according to China Aid, a Christian charity working in China. Though the latter figure is debated, if it's in the ballpark it means the number of Christians outstrip Communist party members (78 million) by tens of millions.

And, for the first time, the underground Christians are standing up for themselves. Two weeks ago, 19 house church leaders delivered a petition to the National People's Congress appealing to lawmakers for the right to worship freely. The letter, which has been posted on the internet, says: "With the incessant growth of the number of urban Christians ¡­ the conflict between State and church of this sort is likely to continue to break out. In view of this ¡­ we hereby lodge this petition." The church leaders, who come from eight major cities including Beijing and Shanghai, fear the petition will spark a new round of action against them.

It might, but what the petition signifies is the growing gall of the house churches. When I met with Li, a house church leader in Shanghai, she told me that the government "knows everything". Li's church, located in Sheshan just outside Shanghai, took precautions by splitting itself between two venues, and leaders attended monthly meetings to placate officials at teahouses. The important thing was to "let [the officials] know we're under their control".

What the government fears is the allegiance of its people to something other than China. Christianity has proved disabling to totalitarian regimes in the past. Just across the Yellow Sea in South Korea, some experts credit the rise of Christianity in the 1960s as one catalyst that pushed the country from dictatorship to democracy. Tellingly, the church leaders opened their letter with: "We are Chinese citizens. We love our country ¡­ and obey and respect the authority of the government to maintain social order."

But, it seems, they're determined to worship on Sundays. This continued defiance of the government sends a clear message: we are here. To stem the spread of Christianity in China, the party is going to have to do more than place a handful of house church leaders under arrest.






The moon is the finest sliver of pale gold in the blackness lying over the Songshan mountains. The wind is rushing down into the valley, shaking the nests of azure-winged magpies, rustling the bamboo and catalpa blossoms and jangling temple bells . . .

"HUNNGGHHH!" Foot thwacks against thigh.

"HAAARRRGGH!" Flesh smacks on to flesh.

It is 8pm on a Saturday evening, but ¨C though you can barely discern them through the mist and shadows ¨C diligent grey-suited teenagers are still pivoting, kicking and punching on the otherwise peaceful slopes above the legendary Shaolin temple.

Welcome to the home of kung fu: a Buddhist monastery, renowned for its warrior monks and inspiration to martial arts enthusiasts around the world, on the dusty outskirts of Dengfeng in the impoverished and otherwise unloved province of Henan.

Here, 60,000 students aged from five to 40 come to hone their fighting skills, plan their careers and dream of their calling.

With next month's release of the children's animated film Kung Fu Panda II, interest in the leopard, tiger, snake, dragon and crane styles of combat practised here looks set to boom. Many of the pupils arrive with about as much talent as Po before his dumpling-fuelled epiphany. Each one shares his dream ¨C to become an all-action hero.

And although only a handful may ever make it, that aspiration is enough to keep them leaping and sparring long into the night.

The legend of the Shaolin monks began around 1,500 years ago. The emperor Xiaowen is said to have ordered the construction of a temple, deep in a mountain forest, in honour of a wandering Indian monk. By the 13th century, it was home to around 2,000 monks, famed for their virtue and skill in martial arts ¨C usually referred to in China as wushu rather than gongfu (kung fu).

"In history, [Shaolin] represented justice, uprightness, sympathy and love," says Wang Yumin, the temple's foreign liaison officer, incongruously clad in a Las Vegas, Nevada T-shirt.

By 1928, when a warlord set fire to the complex, its glory days were long gone. In the 60s, Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution would ravage what remained. When religion re-emerged from the shadows, with the country's reform and opening up three decades ago, there were just 11 "mostly quite elderly" monks in the crumbling buildings.

Shaolin's renaissance is largely the work of a kung fu movie and a very modern monk. In 1982, wushu champion Jet Li appeared in the film Shaolin Temple. It made him an instant star ¨C and Shaolin an instantly recognisable name.

Meanwhile, another young man was making his mark. Shi Yongxin, the son of a farmer and a factory worker from next-door Anhui province, had just joined the monastery and would become its abbot in 1999. Under his watch, its fame has spread as warrior monks tour the world demonstrating their martial prowess.

But for Shi this is just the beginning. "We are trying to spread the temple's values of Shaolin and Buddhism more widely," he says. "Even though it is really famous now, it is still some way from its [historical] skill and reputation."

In early morning, the grey courtyards of Shaolin appear much as they would have done centuries ago. There is nothing to break the tranquillity until a young monk walks through the sleeping quarters at 4am, beating a wooden board to wake his 300 peers.

Morning prayers are followed by a breakfast of rice porridge with vegetables and ¨C for the 100 warrior monks ¨C two eggs apiece. The extra protein fuels their morning training ¨C itself a form of Chan (better known as Zen) Buddhist practice ¨C while others meditate.

But at 8am the gates open and the outside world crowds in. Tourist buggies shuttle through the grounds and the monks disperse to sell incense to pilgrims and begin their half-hourly kung fu performances. At weekends there are so many visitors that the monks dispense with afternoon prayers, says Wang.

Amid the bustle, Liao Chao pauses for a moment, carefully holding up his cameraphone and clicking to capture his first visit to the monastery. For the past 10 years ¨C since leaving school at 14 ¨C he has laboured in a factory in southern Guangdong province, working his way up to become manager. Now he has another ambition: to train here as a wushu coach.

"I've loved martial arts since I was little, but my family were poor and I have four brothers and sisters," he says. "Now I have enough savings, I can come and study here. I've admired [the monastery] for a long time. I've been waiting so long and today I finally get to see it. This is why I kept working so hard: this has always been my dream."

For admirers such as Liao, the temple stands for the moral and physical strength of kung fu. But for others the magic of Shaolin is wearing thin. Many of the tourists seem slightly bored as they watch the warrior monks' performance, consisting mostly of striking poses, though they perk up when one breaks a wooden stave over the other's back.

"To tell you the truth, I thought the show wasn't that good," says Belgian tourist Raphael Doumont. "This place is really nice but the problem is the business part. It's a little bit fake. You see these kiosks . . . I know it is 2011, but there's something I don't like."

Though Doumont is a foreigner, such criticisms are common even in Dengfeng, where people value the income Shaolin has brought but lament relocations (buildings were knocked down to earn the site Unesco World Heritage status); high ticket prices (100 yuan, or ¡ê10, in a very poor province); and general commercialisation.

Chinese media have dubbed Shi "the country's most controversial monk" and "the abbot with the MBA". Certainly, his business acumen extends far beyond the monastery giftshop, with its wushu shoes and tasteful ceramic incense holders.

He has backed the Chinese TV show Kung Fu Star, a sort of Pop Idol for the martial arts world. Shaolin has "franchised" four temples in Kunming, taking over their management at their request, and opened 40 branches overseas. It is a measure of the temple's money-minded reputation ¨C fast rivalling its kung fu fame ¨C that rumours recently spread it was planning to float on the stock exchange. The more prosaic truth, it says, is that it is supporting a new state-backed tourism firm.

Thanks to the headlines such ventures attract, walking through Shaolin with the abbot ¨C a portly figure swathed in saffron robes ¨C is a bit like escorting Donald Trump through Times Square in New York. There are audible gasps from tourists, who rush over with their cameras and phones. One man tries to lean in for a shot alongside Shi, only to be bundled aside by a uniformed guard.

But for every fan there is a detractor, critical not just of the monastery's approach but Shi's own lifestyle. Complaints include his acceptance of a luxury car for services to local tourism and an elaborate embroidered robe from a brocade firm, the gold thread alone costing a reported ¡ê5,000.

Shortly after we visit, the state news agency Xinhua announces that the monastery has asked police to investigate who might be spreading libellous internet rumours that Shi was caught with prostitutes. "The people who made this rumour up will be punished either by law or by karma. It's just a question of time," says Wang, who blames cynics wanting to mock religion and attack famous figures.

Shi says he welcomes scrutiny and acknowledges that the temple's development has been "a really hot topic", but sees commerce and spirituality as complementary. "Through the tourists we solve the problem of making a living and passing on our culture and traditions," he says, while the overseas performances are "a contribution to humans around the world".

But he grows increasingly animated as he discusses rival "Shaolin" tours and others who seek to associate themselves with the monastery.

The temple takes its brand so seriously that it fought a six-year battle with the Chinese trademark office for refusing to register "Shaolin medicine" for use on products including coffee, takeaway foods and instant noodles. Shi says it wants to stop others from issuing substandard products that could damage people's health and the monastery's good name.

"It is quite bitter for us, spending money and time fighting for trademarks and Shaolin's reputation . . . [They] use it to make money; we are fighting to protect our belief and faith. It's a totally different issue," he says.

The monastery insists that kung fu, however lucrative, is secondary to religion for its members. "First they are monks," says Wang. "It doesn't matter if they are warrior monks; they must still meditate and study the scriptures."

But most of the fighting monks are recruited from the students at Dengfeng's 50-plus martial arts schools, where kung fu is not only a way of life but a way of making a living. Henan is one of China's poorest provinces and martial arts offer many kids their best opportunity of building a career; a shot at becoming a bodyguard, soldier or performer rather than an unskilled labourer.

Grandmaster Liang Yiqun, the 82-year-old founder of the Shaolin Epo Wushu college, draws on six generations of kung fu expertise to give his charges an all-round education.

"If a martial artist lacks culture, he is a savage. A scholar without any martial arts skills will find it hard to survive," he declares. They are the words of his grandfather, an imperial bodyguard.

The next are his own: "Speaking honestly, a lot of the students we get are really naughty kids that are not accepted by so-called normal schools," he adds prosaically.

Others come because their parents are migrant workers and they need a boarding school; or so they can fight their way into a sporting university, giving them a chance of higher education. And an increasing number of girls are enjoying the chance to challenge preconceptions.

"People in my home town all think girls should be gentle and soft, while practising martial arts is tough and exhausting. They don't think girls are up to it," says Liang's 18-year-old student Zhang Hongxi, grinning mischievously. "Every time I leave the contest stage, my first thought is whether I have won face for my parents. The second is that it's good to prove that girls can also practise martial arts and be much tougher than guys." Like most of the pupils here, she combines steely will and a practical streak with starry-eyed idealism about her vocation, lauding the dignity and virtue of its champions.

There is only a "really tiny chance" of even the best students becoming kung fu stars, her classmate Chang Xiufeng says pragmatically. But there's a faraway look in his eyes as he recalls the discipline and sheer physical grace that inspires them to train for day after day, night after night.

"When Jackie Chan leaps," the teenager says, "it feels like he's flying . . ."











The Yangtze ¨C Asia's biggest river ¨C is experiencing its worst drought in 50 years, forcing an unprecedented release of water from the Three Gorges reservoir. The drought is damaging crops, threatening wildlife and raising doubts about the viability of China's massive water diversion ambitions.

Between now and 10 June the dam will release 5bn cubic metres of water ¨C equivalent to the volume of Lake Windermere in Britain every day ¨C as engineers sacrifice hydroelectric generation for irrigation, drinking supplies and ecosystem support.

The drastic measure comes amid warnings of power shortages and highlights the severity of the dry spell in the Yangtze delta, which supports 400 million people and 40% of China's economic activity.

From January to April, the worst hit province of Hubei has had 40% less rainfall than the average over the same period since 1961. Shanghai, Jiangsu and Hunan are also severely affected.

Regional authorities have declared more than 1,300 lakes "dead", which means they are out of use for irrigation and drinking supply. Shortages affect 4.4 million people and 3.2 million farm animals, according to the Office of State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters.

The narrowing and shallowing of the Yangtze and its tributaries has stranded thousands of boats and left a 220km stretch off limits for container ships.

The central government has dispatched water pumps and diesel generators to Hubei and Hunan to ease the impact. This is expensive and adds to the pressures on China's energy supply system at a time when the state grid authorities are warning of the worst summer power cuts in seven years.

"The primary cause of this drought is a lack of rainfall. But we can also be certain that the Three Gorges dam has had a negative impact on the water supply downstream," said Ma Jun, founder of the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs. "This is a reminder that the water in the Yangtze is not unlimited. We cannot bet everything on this river. We need to focus more on conservation."

Desperate farmers are pumping water from nature reserves, prompting alarm among conservationists about the loss of habitat for several endangered species including the finless porpoise ¨C the last remaining cetacean on the Yangtze after the demise of the baiji dolphin.

At the Swan Island national nature reserve the depth is three metres lower than last year ¨C which was then a record low. According to Wang Ding, a dolphin expert at the Hydrobiology Institute under the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the habitat of a pod of 30 porpoises has halved in length from 21km to 10km.

"Finless porpoises cannot survive if the level continues to drop," Wang told Xinhua news agency. "If the activity area is reduced they might be stranded on the bank and will die if they can not swim back." There are believed to be 1,000 porpoises left in the river.

The authorities have attempted cloud seeding to induce rain but a brief shower at the weekend was far from enough. China's meteorological administration sees little prospect of rain before the end of the month and says temperatures in the affected region could rise to 36C.

To minimise the impact, the Three Gorges authority has been instructed to open the sluice gates. It has already discharged 1.8bn cubic metres of water this month, taking the level of the reservoir below 153m from a peak of 175m.

The dam's role in the drought has been the subject of a fierce debate. Downstream communities have accused the Three Gorges of holding back too much water to generate power. Environmentalists say this has contributed to the demise of lakes and wetlands, which are already under pressure from urban development and the demands of agriculture. The operators, however, say the reservoir is helping to ease shortages through a timely release of water.

Last week the state council ¨C China's cabinet ¨C acknowledging that Three Gorges faces "urgent problems" of geological disaster prevention, relocation and ecological protection. It noted the negative impact on downstream water supplies and river transport.

The dam is not the only hydro-engineering project that has come under scrutiny as a result of the drought. The state's massive south-north water diversion project, which aims to tap the normally moist Yangtze basin to supply arid northern cities like Beijing, is also being called into question because one of its source reservoirs at Danjiangkou has fallen 4m below the minimum requirement for its operation.

"This is bound to have an impact on the diversion project," said Zhang Junfeng, an environmental activist with Green Earth Volunteers. "Water storage at Danjiangkou reservoir is already at a dead level and I think the situation will get worse year by year because this is partly due to climate change."







Outside the closed gates of the Xilingol Mongolian high school, Chinese police watch warily as hundreds of students perform calisthenics in a yard from where the previous day they left to march through the streets. A short drive away, another police unit monitors a middle school that has become a source of concern. On the grasslands, patrol cars block access to a troubled community of herders and miners.

Security forces in Inner Mongolia, an autonomous region of China, are on high alert after the biggest wave of demonstrations in 20 years, sparked by a killing that symbolises the traumatic transition of Mongolia's nomadic grasslands into a mining powerhouse.

On 11 May, a Han Chinese coal-truck driver ran over a 35-year-old Mongolian herder, known as Mergen, as he tried to stop a convoy driving across fenced prairies in Xiwu.

Allegations the killing was deliberate inflamed passions in the indigenous Mongolian community, which has been squeezed out of much of the land over 50 years.

Protests erupted in at least three places. Video clips ( http://www.smhric.org) posted online by overseas supporters show herders being arrested after a face-off with military police in Ujumchin last week. According to overseas groups, crowds also took to the streets in Huveet Shar on Thursday and Shuluun Huh on Friday with banners declaring: "Defend the rights of Mongols" and "Defend the homeland".

The biggest protest was in Xilinhot, where 1,000 students in yellow and blue uniforms marched through the broad streets to the government headquarters on Wednesday.

"This was the largest protest since 1991," said Enghebatu Togochog, director of the US-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Centre, which calls for more autonomy for the region and respect for traditional lifestyles. "There are increasing conflicts between herders and miners as the authorities open up more mines in the grasslands to meet their goal of turning Inner Mongolia into the nation's energy base."

In recent years, Inner Mongolia has become China's leading producer of coal and rare earth elements.

Details of the killing that sparked the protests are sketchy, second-hand and may have been exaggerated by internet rumours and a lack of trust in censored official news. Locals said 35-year-old Mergen was leading about 40 herders who tried to block a convoy of coal trucks from the Tongcheng No 2 colliery. The drivers had reportedly run down fences and intruded on nomads' land to avoid a bumpy road. After a protracted stand-off, the drivers are said to have crashed through the herders, killing Mergen.

One widely cited but unverifiable claim is that the driver boasted he was sufficiently insured to cover the death of a "smelly Mongolian herder".

The author of this report ¨C a Mongolian blogger named Zorigt ¨C wrote: "In order to take a shortcut, these coal-hauling trucks have randomly run over local herders' grazing lands, not only killing numerous heads of livestock but also further damaging the already weakened fragile grassland."

Students place more faith in such blogs than the government version of events. "We are very angry. They killed him on purpose and dragged him along the ground for more than 100 metres. This has made us realise that Mongolian lives are worthless," said a 16-year-old female student from the Xilingol high school. "If this issue is not resolved, there will be more protests."

Many students are from herding families who have been moved into cities as the wide-open pastures are fenced off. The government says such measures are necessary to promote development, prevent overgrazing and protect the fragile grasslands, much of which have turned to desert in recent years. Locals say herders' rights have been violated and the fencing and mining have created bigger environmental problems, including pollution, noise, traffic and dust storms that blow across much of north-east Asia.

The transformation is evident on the flight to Xilinhot. From the air, the grasslands are blotched with sandy areas near farms and the dark smudges of open-cast pits. From the road, the clouds of dust from mines and trucks is visible miles away.

Mergen's death has turned him into a martyr for those who are unhappy with the loss and degradation of land. "He is a hero," said another female student in a yellow uniform. "I don't like to see barriers between Han and Mongols, but sometimes it is necessary to fight for your land."

Anger at the killing is focused on the truckers and the mining firms. It does not appear to have set the two main ethnic groups against one another. Many Han residents said they supported the Mongolian students, whose demonstration was peaceful. Shopkeepers said they provided free food and drink to the marchers. Taxi drivers expressed sympathy for their cause, and a restaurant owner spoke of the need for justice. But others were worried that the situation might deteriorate.

Mongolian activists have called for rolling protests through the region, culminating in a rally in Genghis Khan Square in Hulunbuir on Monday.

The authorities have tried to placate protesters by arresting four men for the killing and damage to grasslands, with a promise of a full investigation and compensation for the bereaved.

Mergen's brother said the family have been given money, but declined to say how much. "I don't want to answer any more questions about this," he said by phone.

Local radio runs frequent bulletins about the police investigation, but there are few details and little transparency. An official at the Xilinhot propaganda department claimed to be unaware of any protests. The phone rang unanswered at other government offices.

Outsiders are unwelcome. The Guardian was blocked on the road into West Ujimchin where Mergen was killed. "Special circumstances. You're not allowed in. It's not safe," said an officer. At 4.30 the next morning, two plainclothes police entered the Guardian's hotel room, woke this correspondent and tried to conduct an interrogation.

Chinese authorities are nervous about signs of unrest in areas with large ethnic minorities, such as Tibet and Xinjiang, which also experience tensions between herders and mining settlers. Inner Mongolia is usually considered less of a security threat because its overseas supporters are less vocal in calling for independence, it does not have a charismatic leader such as the Dalai Lama and its indigenous community has already been numerically overwhelmed by an influx of Han migrants who now comprise 79% of the population.

But there is a heavy security presence, and police are ruthless in quashing dissent. Last December, the region's most famous writer and activist, Hada, was due for release from prison after 15 years. He has not been seen since and is presumed to be under house arrest.
