We call him Robbie. He's our other son. 
He loves his grandfather very much. 
Well, that's our family, the Stewarts. 
Did you follow me? Let's see. 
Who is my daughter? That's it. Susan is my daughter. 
How about this? 
Who is Robbie's grandfather? 
Malcolm is Robbie's grandfather. 
Okay, who is Susan's sister-in-law? 
Marilyn is Susan's sister-in-law. 
That's right. 
Well, that's our family and I love them all.
