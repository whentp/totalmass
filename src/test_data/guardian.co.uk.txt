After denouncing a lewd photograph sent through his Twitter account as the work of a hacker, Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner now says he "maybe" was the source of the bulging underpants.

With Washington entranced by the mysterious case of "Weiner's weiner", quickly dubbed "Weinergate", the talkative New York City politician attempted to zip up the underwear affair. But a series of ill-tempered and evasive interviews left Weiner in an even more uncomfortable position.

While Weiner maintains that the photograph was sent through his Twitter and Yfrog photo-sharing account to a young woman by unknown hackers, he stopped short of denying his involvement as the subject or creator of the crotch-shot.

Asked if the photograph was of him, in an interview with NBC News, Weiner merely replied: "You know, I can't say with certitude." Pressed for a denial, in the course of a rambling answer Weiner said:

I will say that we're trying to figure out exactly what happened here. Whether a photograph was manipulated that was found in my account, whether something was dropped into my account, whether a photograph was partially my account, you know.

Weiner previously had a verbal tussle with CNN when it asked a similar question, eventually calling one CNN journalist a "jackass" on camera.

Later, talking to the New York Times, Weiner suggested "there were elements of this photograph that might have been doctored," while in a later appearance on MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show the congressman admitted: "Maybe it started out being a photograph of mine," claiming that "stuff gets manipulated".

The women sent the distasteful image ¨C a 21-year-old student who had followed Weiner on Twitter ¨C has denied any knowledge or other connection to Weiner.

Weiner, one of New York's most high profile politicians and a possible contender for the city's mayoralty, is married to an aide to secretary of state Hillary Clinton.

The Brooklyn and Queens representative says he has hired lawyers and private investigators to look at possible legal action but as yet has not contacted police.

The affair of the well-filled underwear ¨C first reported by the conservative news site Big Government ¨C has been fodder for grateful comedians. Jon Stewart ¨C a friend and former housemate of Weiner's ¨C told his Daily Show audience:

Seriously. No way! No way! In real life my memory is this cat had a lot more Anthony and a lot less Weiner. This is not what I remember.

At this rate the scandal is becoming more than just a bad joke for Weiner. As NBC's Luke Russert told Weiner after one lengthy non-answer: "But Congressman, you would remember if you were to take a photograph of yourself like that."






Tornadoes have roared through Massachusetts, killing at least four people.

The storms caused extensive damage in Springfield, the state's third-largest city.

Authorities said two people died in West Springfield, one in Springfield and another in Brimfield. State police said 33 people were injured in Springfield, five of whom required surgery.

The state governor, Deval Patrick, said the path of damage from the first and more powerful of the two tornadoes extended from Westfield, just west of Springfield, to the community of Douglas. He said the second cut a path from West Springfield to Sturbridge in the central part of the state.

A state of emergency has been declared.

Bob Pashko of West Springfield said he was leaving his doctor's office when the storm started.

"The next thing you know the TV says a tornado hit the railroad bridge in West Springfield," said Pashko, 50. "It's the baddest I've seen."

The Rev Bob Marrone of the First Church of Monson said the storm cleared a view he had never seen before across the valley where the town sits.

"I can see the plywood of roofs, and see houses where most of the house is gone," he said. "The road that runs up in front of my house ... There's so many trees down, it's completely impassable."

The storm hit the Springfield area after a tornado watch was issued for much of the east coast, including Philadelphia, New York and Boston.

Senator John Kerry said he would join Patrick in a planned tour of tornado damage on Wednesday night.

Patrick said there was extensive damage in Hampden county, especially to homes . He said at least 48,000 homes were without electricity. The state has opened emergency shelters.

Patrick repeated his call for superintendents in the 19 affected communities to cancel school on Thursday. He said state employees in those areas also are urged to stay home and off the roads to give cleanup crews a chance to work.

The governor said he had received preliminary reports of looting in Springfield but that it had tapered off as heavy rains set in.









A British honeymoon couple murdered in Antigua were found lying in a bloodied scene in their luxury resort, a court has heard.

Ben and Catherine Mullany, both 31, died after an apparent botched robbery at their beachside hotel just over a fortnight after their wedding day.

Horrific details emerged as a medic recalled treating Ben Mullany as the injured man desperately tried to communicate with emergency workers. But those battling to save him were unable to make out his words, jurors were told.

The student physiotherapist died a week after the attack.

Describing the murder scene that met emergency workers called to the secluded spot on the morning of 27 July 2008, emergency medical technician Loretta Ephraim told how she found Catherine Mullany lying lifeless on the floor and her husband in a similar position on the bed in their chalet at 6.15am.

"When we got in, I noticed blood and mosquito nets over the bed," she told the court.

"There was a male on the bed and there was a female lying down on the floor next to the bed.

"The female was lying very still, on the floor. Her eyes were open, wide open, but there were no movements coming from her."

Speaking at the trial of Avie Howell, 20 and Kaniel Martin, 23, who both deny murder, she described how she had arrived at the hillside cottage to find armed officers and police standing guard.

Inside, she worked on Ben Mullany, attempting to place a brace around his neck and stem the bleeding from his head.

"While I was putting the bandage on ... he tried to say something but I couldn't understand what he was saying," she said.

He was moving slightly and had a large swelling on the back of his bloodied head. There was more blood on his pillow, the court was told.

"We placed a collar around his neck and we also placed him on a board to support his back," Ephraim said.

Once immobilised, Ben Mullany was taken to Holberton hospital.

"When we got into the ambulance he became very restless," the medic said.

"We checked his blood pressure, how he was bleeding, his pulse, everything at the time was OK and then we left for the hospital.

"On our way to the hospital he was even more restless.

"He was trying to speak but we couldn't understand what he was trying to say so I spoke to him to see how much I could give him some comfort."

On arrival, he became much calmer, she said.

Earlier the court heard how the couple had been shot by the same gun that was later turned on local shopkeeper, Woneta Anderson.

The 43-year-old was killed in an "almost identical" attack the next month, prosecutor Anthony Armstrong told jurors.

Opening the case, he said Howell and Martin could be linked to all three murders.

The Mullanys, from Swansea, south Wales, had been staying at the Cocos hotel and were on the last day of their honeymoon when they were attacked.

Ben Mullany, a former South Yorkshire police officer who had also served in the British army, was later transported back to Britain for treatment but died a week after the shootings.

On 8 August, Howell and Martin allegedly struck again, this time killing Anderson.

"The manner in which these three people were killed was almost identical," Armstrong said.

"All three victims were shot in the head. They were shot with a single bullet, no more, no less. All three victims were killed using the same firearm," he said.

The nature of the killings ruled out the possibility that either of the accused were acting in self defence or following provocation, the prosecutor told the court.

As the case against them began, nearly three years after the murders, neither defendant showed emotion. Both sat in the open dock at Antigua's high court in the capital city, St John's, with their hands clasped together, listening intently to the evidence.

The crown, which plans to call about 70 witnesses during the trial, will rely on ballistic, DNA, documentary, medical and mobile phone evidence.

Howell and Martin both deny three counts of murder.

The trial continues.






Danish navy commandos have ended the occupation of an Arctic drilling rig by Greenpeace by breaking into the protesters' survival pod hanging off the drilling platform.

The navy unit broke into the pod just before midnight, four days after the two activists began their occupation of the drilling platform of Leiv Eiriksson, an oil exploration vessel operated by the British firm Cairn Energy.

The arrests of Luke Jones, from Leeds, and Hannah McHardy, from the US, end a 10-day long action by Greenpeace and its protest ship Esperanza against Cairn's drilling operations off Greenland. The activists are now being held and are likely to be deported.

Last year, four Greenpeace protesters occupied another Cairn rig in the same area for about 30 hours after attaching a climbing platform under the structure. That protest was brought to an end by severe weather.

Ben Ayliffe, a Greenpeace International campaigner on board the Esperanza, said: "Our team stopped this rig from drilling for four days, which was four days in which a Deepwater Horizon-style blowout couldn't happen and this beautiful fragile environment was safe.

"Our climbers are in jail now, but this won't stop us opposing the madness of drilling for oil in a region where a spill would be almost impossible to clean up. This isn't over. We'll keep on pushing till the oil companies get out of the Arctic."

Cairn denies that its drilling operation was affected by the occupation. It and Greenland's government insist that its oil spill emergency plan is detailed and comprehensive, and argue that oil wells have been sited in the Arctic for several decades.









The global war on drugs has failed and governments should explore legalising marijuana and other controlled substances, according to a commission that includes former heads of state and a former UN secretary general.

A new report by the Global Commission on Drug Policy argues that the decades-old "global war on drugs has failed, with devastating consequences for individuals and societies around the world." The 24-page paper was released on Thursday.

"Political leaders and public figures should have the courage to articulate publicly what many of them acknowledge privately: that the evidence overwhelmingly demonstrates that repressive strategies will not solve the drug problem, and that the war on drugs has not, and cannot, be won," the report said.

The 19-member commission includes former UN chief Kofi Annan and former US official George Schultz, who held cabinet posts under Ronald Reagan and Richard Nixon. Others include former chairman of the US Federal Reserve Paul Volcker, former presidents of Mexico, Brazil and Colombia, the authors Carlos Fuentes and Mario Vargas Llosa, the businessman Sir Richard Branson and the Greek prime minister, George Papandreou.

Instead of punishing users, who the report says "do no harm to others", the commission argues that governments should end criminalisation of drug use; experiment with legal models that would undermine organised crime syndicates; and offer health and treatment services for drug-users in need.

The commission called for drug policies based on methods empirically proven to reduce crime, lead to better health and promote economic and social development.

The commission is especially critical of the US, which its members say must lead changing its anti-drug policies from being guided by anti-crime approaches to ones rooted in healthcare and human rights.

"We hope this country [the US] at least starts to think there are alternatives," said the former Colombian president C¨¦sar Gaviria.

The office of White House drug tsar, Gil Kerlikowske, said the report was misguided.

"Drug addiction is a disease that can be successfully prevented and treated. Making drugs more available ¨C as this report suggests ¨C will make it harder to keep our communities healthy and safe," spokesman said, citing statistics showing declines in US drug use compared with 30 years ago, along with a more recent 46% drop in current cocaine use among young adults over the last five years.

The report cited UN estimates that opiate use increased 34.5% worldwide and while the use of cannabis, or marijuana, was up 8.5%.






The Japanese prime minister, Naoto Kan, has comfortably survived a no-confidence motion after offering to resign as soon as plans for Japan's recovery from the tsunami and nuclear crisis are in place.

MPs in the 480-seat lower house of Japan's parliament voted down the motion on Thursday afternoon by 293 votes to 152.

By offering to quit, possibly in the autumn, Kan, whose handling of the post-tsunami recovery and the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident has drawn criticism from opposition parties, has bought himself a few more months in office.

The move will enable him to oversee the operation to stabilise the nuclear plant ¨C which is expected to take several months ¨C and to secure emergency funding for the reconstruction of the country's battered north-east coast.

The fate of Thursday's motion, submitted by the main opposition Liberal Democratic party (LDP) and other opposition parties, was sealed after Kan's main rival in his own Democratic party of Japan (DPJ), Ichiro Ozawa, indicated he would abstain along with 50 of his supporters, having earlier threatened to side with the opposition.

Although he survived the motion, Kan faces a difficult few months, during which he is expected to struggle to reach deals on emergency budgets in a deeply divided parliament, and to introduce a controversial tax rise.

The no-confidence motion has exposed divisions inside his own party, with DPJ executives vowing to take action against rebel MPs who voted with the opposition.

Kan, who has been in office for almost a year, managed to pre-empt his opponents earlier in the day when he pledged to resign once his disaster mission was complete, and suggested it was time the political elite made way for a new generation.

"I would like the younger generation to take over various responsibilities once I have finished fulfilling certain roles as a I work on handling the disaster," he told DPJ MPs.

"The nuclear crisis is ongoing, and I will make my utmost efforts to end the crisis and move forward with post-quake reconstruction work."

His offer to resign convinced his predecessor, Yukio Hatoyama, who also leads a large DPJ faction, to withdraw his support for the no-confidence motion.

Kyodo News reported that Ozawa, a longtime Kan nemesis and notorious power broker, would abstain.

At one stage it had looked possible that opposition parties would come tantalisingly close to securing the votes of the 80 or so governing party MPs they needed to force Kan to resign or call a general election.

Kan, Japan's fifth prime minister since 2006, remained vague about when he would step down. Shizuka Kamei, the leader of a minor partner, said he should resign as soon as the nuclear crisis has been resolved.

Kan's success in buying time to oversee the start of Japan's reconstruction, which could cost up to ¡ê113bn, has all but ruined the prospects for a grand coalition comprising the DPJ and the LDP, whose leader, Sadakazu Tanigaki, was behind the no-confidence motion.

"Among possible scenarios the best one would be Kan voluntarily resigning and the DPJ forming a coalition with the LDP to stabilise politics," said Yasuo Yamamoto, senior economist at the Mizuho research institute in Tokyo. "Unstable politics would weigh on stock prices and delay reconstruction after the disaster.

"From both Japanese and foreign investors' point of view, now is not the time for political turmoil. Japan has various issues it needs to address swiftly ¨C not only reconstruction but also tax and social security reform, TPP [a trans-Pacific free trade agreement] and energy policy, which requires political initiative."

The return to business as usual in Nagatacho, Tokyo's political nerve centre, has been met with anger and disbelief in the country's north-east, where about 100,000 people are still living in evacuation shelters and construction of temporary housing is behind schedule.

The damage to the region's administrative infrastructure would have made it all but impossible for some communities to take part in a general election had the no-confidence motion succeeded.

"We are in a situation of having to delay the prefectural assembly election because elections cannot be held in our prefecture right now," Miyagi prefecture's governor, Yoshihiro Murai, told reporters. "It will be difficult to hold a lower house election, especially in the municipalities along the coast."

An 82-year-old resident of Kamaishi who was living in a local school told the Asahi Shimbun: "Once things become more settled in the region struck by the disaster, they can go ahead and dissolve the lower house as many times as they like. If they dissolve it now, I will abstain from voting."







Three Chechen men have been convicted in Austria for their role in an exile's death during a botched kidnapping that authorities allege was ordered by Chechnya's president, Ramzan Kadyrov.

Umar Israilov, 27, was shot dead outside his Vienna flat in January 2009. The suspected gunman has fled the country, prosecutors have said.

Austrian investigators have said they believed ¨C mostly based on circumstantial evidence ¨C that Kadyrov ordered a kidnapping of Israilov that went fatally awry.

Kadyrov's spokesman, Alvi Karimov, has denied the president's involvement in the murder, which followed Israilov's attempt to bring the Kremlin-backed leader before the European court of human rights on torture charges.

The Vienna court on Wednesday handed three men sentences of life, 19 years and 16 years, the Austria Press Agency reported.

Prosecutors had demanded life sentences for Chechnya-born Otto Kaltenbrunner, Suleiman Dadayev and Turpal Ali Yesherkayev on charges of abetting murder, acting as a foreign agent and conspiracy. The defendants' lawyers had called for acquittals.

The three men were also ordered to pay damages of €25,000 (¡ê22,000) to Israilov's family.

The court's attempts to get Kadyrov to testify via video link came to nothing.

"It is up to you whether you will allow political murders to take place in Austria," the prosecutor Leopold Bien told the jury.

Amnesty International's Heinz Patzelt welcomed the verdict and appealed to Russia to follow up on the case, noting the court had made clear "the people in the background are to be sought abroad and that this is a political contract murder."

Chechnya remains volatile a decade after Moscow drove separatists out of power in the second of two wars. The Kremlin credits Kadyrov ¨C who fought against Russia in the first war but then switched sides ¨C with maintaining security in the region.

But rights activists say that in return for relative stability the Kremlin turns a blind eye to Kadyrov's heavy-handed rule and torture at home and abroad, accusations he has denied.

Dubai police have accused an adviser to Kadyrov, Adam Delimkhanov, of masterminding the March 2009 killing of a Chechen, Sulim Yamadayev, in the emirate, which he denied.

Yamadayev's brother Isa has accused Kadyrov of the killing, as well as of orchestrating the 2008 murder of his other brother Ruslan, though Isa has since made peace with Kadyrov.






A Malaysian social activist will apologise 100 times on Twitter in an unusual settlement with a magazine publisher in a defamation case.

The penalty has sparked debate among internet users about the pitfalls of social media in Malaysia, where authorities have warned people to be more cautious about what they write on blogs, Facebook and Twitter.

Fahmi Fadzil, an opposition politician's aide and respected commentator on social issues, claimed on Twitter in January that his pregnant friend had been poorly treated by her employers at a magazine run by BluInc Media.

Fahmi wrote an apology to BluInc on Twitter a few hours after making that allegation, but the company's lawyers later sent him a letter demanding unspecified financial damages for defamation and another apology in major newspapers, said Fahmi's lawyer, Syahredzan Johan.

Syahredzan said Fahmi settled the case this week by agreeing to apologise 100 times over three days on Twitter, where he has more than 4,200 followers. Syahredzan declined to say who suggested the terms.

"I've DEFAMED Blu Inc Media and Female Magazine. My tweets on their HR [human resource] policies are untrue. I retract those words and hereby apologise," Fahmi wrote in a series of tweets starting on Thursday that came out about once every 30 minutes.

BluInc's legal firm said that the lawyer handling the case could not be contacted. Officials at the publishing company familiar with the matter were not available for comment. BluInc publishes more than 20 lifestyle and health magazines in Malaysia.

Fahmi told his followers he could not elaborate on the case, but many prominent Twitter users in Malaysia voiced sympathy for him.

"First time witnessing a 'community service sentence' on Twitter," blogger Christopher Tock wrote. "Will this be something common in future years?"

Syahredzan said it was believed to be the first settlement involving the use of Twitter in a Malaysian defamation case.

"We're in uncharted waters," Syahredzan said, adding that the case could cause Malaysians to become more aware of the repercussions of their comments on social media.

Over the past year Malaysian authorities have arrested or filed charges against several people who made statements on Facebook that allegedly insulted the country's royalty or stirred religious tensions. A government minister is taking legal action against a blogger who accused him of raping an Indonesian housemaid.









Most people might associate a trip to a superstore with stocking up on groceries and cleaning products. But residents of Phoenix, Arizona, will now be able to frequent a "medical marijuana superstore", the first of its kind in the state.

WeGrow, which bills itself as "the first honest hydro store" ¨C a reference to hydroponics, a method of growing plants using mineral nutrient liquids without soil ¨C opened for business in the city on Wednesday.

"We sell everything but the plant itself," said company founder Dhar Mann. "We sell the products and the services for people to safely and responsibly cultivate their medicine."

The 21,000 sq ft store offers 2,000 products, including UV lights, root stimulator, fertiliser, CO2 generators and pruning scissors, all of which are specifically designed for growing marijuana, and can also be bought online.

WeGrow already has two stores in Oakland and Sacramento, both in California. The Phoenix store's opening came on the same day that Arizona was due to have begun accepting applications for the 125 permits the state plans to grant for the operation of medical marijuana dispensaries. That process was put on hold last week after state officials sought federal court clarification on whether its citizens were at risk of federal prosecution for participating in activities sanctioned by Arizona voters in November.

Arizona is the 16th state in the US to decriminalise marijuana for medical purposes. However Dennis Burke, the US attorney for Arizona, has warned in a letter to state health officials last month that the cultivation, sale and distribution of cannabis, classified by the US government as an illegal narcotic, remains a federal crime.

Figures show that 3,696 people have obtained cards allowing them to possess and grow marijuana for a range of medical issues, chronic pain chief among them. Men account for more than 75% of those approved.








Two climate activists were jailed on Wednesday by a Danish court for incitement to violence against police officers after they shouted the word "push" during a demonstration outside the 2009 UN climate negotiations in Copenhagen. The two women in their 20s, Tannie Nyboe and Stine Gry Jonassen, were judged to have endangered the lives of police officers who were trying to hold back a crowd of demonstrators attempting to force their way through to the conference centre in which the talks were taking place.

The court heard how the pair, both members of the environmental protest group Climate Justice Action, had counted down from 10 and then shouted "push" using a microphone. For this they were found guilty of inciting violence by four of the six judges and sentenced to four months in prison, two of which were suspended.

Their defence lawyer, Thorkild H?yer, said the judgment was "foolish" and sent the wrong message. "This was one of the most peaceful demonstrations to take place during the whole COP15 [climate conference]. It wasn't violent, nobody got hurt and nobody was arrested at the time. By passing this judgment they are sending the message that even if you plan a peaceful protest you will be arrested anyway, so it follows that people may think 'Why should I bother being peaceful at all?'" he said.

Wednesday's decision was the latest twist in a case that has been continuing for some months. Last November the pair were found guilty of the same offence in a city court and given suspended sentences. But public prosecutor Henrik Aagaard considered the judgment too lenient and appealed for it to be re-examined in the high court, which duly decided to pass a stiffer sentence to reflect the danger posed to the police and send a clear message to demonstrators about the severity of this type of protest action.

"We wanted the case reopened because we believe this kind of action should warrant a prison sentence," Aagaard told news agency Ritzau.

But H?yer, the womens' defence lawyer, didn't see it that way. "Some of the so-called demonstrators were delegates attempting to get into the conference. If anyone has committed a crime here it's the police, who illegally prevented delegates from attending the talks," he said.

Denmark has been the focus of criticism for the way it handled demonstrations during the 2009 climate conference, with accusations of heavy-handedness levelled at the police.









The cost of insuring Greek government bonds rose on Thursday after ratings agency Moody's said there was now a 50% chance of the country defaulting on its debts.

The warning came as Moody's cut Greece's credit rating to Caa1, almost the lowest rating assigned to any country. The move intensified the pressure on European leaders as negotiations over a second rescue package for Greece continued in Vienna.

This "troika review", involving the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank, is rumoured to be close to agreeing a new ¡ê6.4bn deal for Greece.

Moody's justified the downgrade by arguing that Greece will fail to meet the deficit reduction targets that were set as part of its existing bailout deal. The Athens government, though, said Moody's had failed to appreciate the efforts it is taking to bring its debts under control.

"Over five-year investment horizons, around 50% of Caa1-rated sovereigns, non-financial corporate and financial institutions have consistently met their debt-service requirements," Moody's said. "Around 50% have defaulted."

It now costs €1.455m to insure €10m of Greek debt until 2016, after traders pushed the five-year Greek credit default swap (CDS) contract up by 25 basis points to 1455, according to data from Markit. In contrast, the Spanish CDS was trading at 252bp.

"The downgrade ¡­ adds to negative sentiment ahead of the troika review results, which are expected before the weekend," said Gavan Nolan, director of credit research at Markit. "A bailout is expected to follow by the end of the month. ECB and EC officials still appear to be at odds over the issue of rescheduling debt, though there are signs that the ECB is becoming more flexible."

Bloomberg reported that Greece has "entered the debt rating hall of shame", with only Ecuador sporting a worse rating.

Nolan added that the prices of Greek debt already imply that the country's credit rating is even lower, at CCC.

There was encouragement, though, that the Vienna talks might achieve a breakthrough soon. According to Reuters, Greece has agreed new austerity measures, including tax rises, in return for the ¡ê6.4bn package of aid. This "medium-term fiscal plan" could be presented by Greek prime minister George Papandreou on Friday.







Rising commodity prices, a changing climate and a growing population have combined to push food security to the top of the international agenda, and have also dominated coverage on the Global development site this week.

Our Global food crisis interactive highlights the big issues in the current food debate, through blogs, features, video, galleries and audio reports.

What you said: Some of the best comments from our readers

On our Talk point on how to feed the world, GrazianoDaSilva, a candidate for FAO president, wrote:

If food is produced and consumed locally, this adds an extra stimulus to economic development in the poorest communities. It's a virtuous circle we all should look for.
On our blog, the trouble with gender economics, KBachan wrote:

The girl-only rhetoric also shifts policies away from tackling the relational aspects of discrimination. Expecting a targeted investment in girls to succeed in eliminating violence and harmful practices without targeting boys, men and traditional power holders is absurd.
On Jimmy Kainja's blog post on DfID freezing aid to Malawi, crwilliams wrote:

My concern with the British government's potential freeze is that it reinforces the message that we in the "west" prefer recipient governments to be accountable to donor governments rather than their own people, subverting the whole notion of responsible statehood.

the former Bosnian Serb general arrested last week on genocide charges, may be extradited to the tribunal at The Hague in the next four days, say Serbian officials.

The officials said delaying tactics by defence lawyers could not put off the extradition beyond the end of the week. Mladic's lawyer, Milos Saljic, filed an appeal on Monday against his extradition to the war crimes tribunal at The Hague, sending it by post in the hope of slowing the process.

Court officials will need to wait for the document and review it before moving forward with the case.

According to Belgrade press reports, lawyers acting for Mladic's co-accused, the former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic, attempted a similar ploy after he was arrested two years ago. But the appeal was lost in the post and Karadzic was extradited five days later.

Saljic has asked for a battery of doctors to examine his client and said he would argue that Mladic was not in a fit state to stand trial. "His health is in an alarming state; he must be examined by cardiologists, neurosurgeons, orthopaedists, gastroenterologists," he said.

Meanwhile, the Serbian government denied that Mladic's arrest had been the result of a secret deal with the west to ensure the country's eventual membership of the EU.

The minister in charge of relations with the Hague tribunal, Rasim Ljajic, said: "There was no trade with Mladic's extradition." He said Serbia "would probably become a candidate for EU membership whether or not Mladic is extradited".

"We have arrested Mladic when we could, when we could reach him, and when we were sure we were following the right trail," he said.

Thousands of ultra-nationalists rallied in Belgrade on Sunday to protest against the arrest, denouncing the president, Boris Tadic, as a traitor. Ljajic has said the arrest was essential for Serbia's national interests and for regional reconciliation.

At a press conference on Monday, Ljajic gave new details of Mladic's movements during his years on the run from an international arrest warrant for genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.

During Slobodan Milosevic's rule, Mladic stayed in three army barracks, at Stragari, Rajac and Krcmar, Ljajic said. After Milosevic was ousted and sent to The Hague, and a new government signed an agreement with the tribunal to pursue Mladic in 2002, his supporters transferred him to an apartment in Belgrade. In 2005, he was taken to the village of Ljube, and to three more locations before his arrest.

One of those locations was presumably the northern village of Lazarevo, where he was arrested on 26 May at the home of his cousin, Branko. There have been unconfirmed reports in the Serbian press that Mladic was sheltered by priests from the Serbian Orthodox church. Ljajic said the government was investigating if members of the state security services and the clergy had helped Mladic evade justice.

A friend of Mladic said that in Belgrade he had lived a normal life. "Everybody came to pay their respects. He was not the type to sit around and do nothing," Aleksandar Mihailovic said. "He loved songs, rakia, eating ¨C he was a normal person."










I was surprised at how Leo Benedictus represented one of Bulgaria's most highly rated TV shows (Is this TV show cursed?, G2, 5 May). "The Bulgarian TV show Otechestven Front ¨C which translates loosely as The Home Front ¨C does seem to be experiencing a cluster of bad luck," he writes. The "Fatherland Front" programme features ordinary people. Most of their stories are not glossy: many Bulgarians live on the edge of survival.

Many of our characters are lonely people, people from minorities, women and children who are victims of trafficking, people with Aids, drug addicts. Before we achieved democracy, we were not allowed to talk about these people. Benedictus obviously thinks this funny: "Think of a macabre That's Life, or a clothed Eurotrash, and you'll be getting warm," he says.

Thanks to one of our investigations a Bulgarian MP was sentenced for paedophilia (a suspended sentence only ¨C the Bulgarian law system is another thing that Fatherland Front is trying to fight).

Benedictus says: "Over the past two years, no fewer than six of the show's subjects have died shortly after taking part." And he continues: "The first was a particularly unpleasant former criminal known as The Rose, who collapsed a matter of days after his interview was filmed, amid rumours of black magic." For the record, Marin the Rose was filmed five times for the show, from 2006 onwards. He was from an "at-risk" group and had spent most of his life in prison. He died after a drink-related fight.

Next, Benedictus says: "An 85-year-old woman called Gena, who told [presenter Martin Karbowski] her legs had been eaten by dogs, was next, dying in her sleep." This poor woman died a year and a half after we broadcast the interview with her ¨C because of the injuries, trauma and shock caused by the dog attack she'd suffered. According to the doctors, after the accident her death was just a matter of time.

"Another victim was Ivanka Arsova, the 62-year-old owner of an icon of the Virgin Mary and Child, which was reputed to cry real tears and became a site of pilgrimage. In her case, it was an undiagnosed cancer that killed her, shortly after she claimed to have been visited by a stranger saying 'God was calling'." In fact, she had been ill before and during the interview.

"Last month brought the strangest case of all, when Halil Baev, a herbalist, was killed in a fire that destroyed his house. Having been rescued once, Baev would have survived, had he not returned in an attempt to rescue his black cat. Nova TV, which transmits Otechestven Front, says they are aware of the supposed curse, and are 'looking into it'." This "case" doesn't even refer to Fatherland Front but to another TV programme presented by me, which is in a completely different format.

It is not nice to make fun of other people's misfortunes. Besides, Fatherland Front has been on air for five years, and has interviewed more than 300 people. If six of them have died this is a normal mortality rate. It is well known that a big part of Europe is hardly surviving, and this is what we show. Perhaps Benedictus believes the whole of Bulgaria is cursed?






Mladic, who is is awaiting extradition to a UN tribunal, made the visit early on Tuesday morning under tight security, said Serbia's deputy war crimes prosecutor, Bruno Vekaric. Mladic is expected to be extradited to the tribunal in The Haguelate on Tuesday or early on Wednesday.

"We didn't announce his visit to the grave because it is his private thing and because it represented a security risk," Vekaric said. "The operation lasted for 20 minutes and passed without a glitch."

Europe's most wanted war crimes fugitive was arrested on Thursday in a village north of Belgrade after 16 years on the run. Mladic is charged by the tribunal for atrocities committed by his Serb troops during Bosnia's 1992-95 war.

His 23-year-old daughter Ana killed herself in 1994 with her father's pistol. Media reports at the time said she did it because of depression caused by her father's role in the war. Mladic has always claimed she was killed by his wartime enemies.

Mladic visited the red marble grave with a cross at a graveyard on a hill in a Belgrade suburb. There, he left a lit candle and a small white bouquet of flowers with a red rose in the middle.

Mladic's lawyer said on Monday that he has formally filed an appeal against the former general's extradition ¨C a move that will likely delay his handover to The Hague until Tuesday night or Wednesday morning. Milos Saljic also has asked for several doctors to examine the 69-year-old Mladic, who is said to have suffered at least two strokes.

Saljic said he mailed his appeal from an unidentified post office in Belgrade on Monday. Court officials will now need to wait for it to arrive and review it before ruling on the appeal.

Vekaric accused Mladic of using delaying tactics and said nothing should prevent his extradition to the tribunal. The prosecutor said no one will be informed when Mladic will be transported from his prison and flown to the Netherlands "because of security risks".

On Monday, the Serbian president, Boris Tadic, rejected speculation that authorities had known of Mladic's hiding place and delayed his arrest to coincide with a visit by EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton. The rumours have persisted because Mladic was found living not far from the capital, Belgrade, with relatives who share his last name.

"Any such comment makes no sense," Tadic said. "The truth is that we arrested Ratko Mladic the moment we discovered him."

The president also said it's time for the European Union to do its part by boosting his nation's efforts to join the bloc, arguing the arrest of Mladic proves it is serious about rejoining the international fold. "I simply ask the EU to fulfil its part," he said. "We fulfilled our part and we will continue to do so."

The EU had repeatedly said that Serbia could begin pre-membership talks only after it arrested the wartime Bosnian Serb commander. Some EU nations have already said Serbia needs to do more, including arresting its last fugitive, Goran Hadzic, who led Croatian Serb rebels during the war.









A former chairman of one of Egypt's major banks has been arrested on charges of sexually abusing a maid at a Manhattan hotel, just weeks after the arrest of former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn on similar allegations, police said.

Mahmoud Abdel Salam Omar was accused of sexually abusing the maid at the Pierre, a luxury hotel near Central Park and Fifth Avenue on the upper east side, police said.

The maid was called to Omar's room on Sunday night to drop off tissues, police said. But once inside the 74-year-old's room, police said Omar would not let her leave and touched her inappropriately. The encounter was not reported until Monday when Omar was arrested, police said.

Paul Browne, a police spokesman, said detectives found the complainant to be credible.

Omar was held on Monday night at a police station.

Police said further details would be released at the suspect's arraignment, which is expected to take place on Tuesday.

Omar is the former chairman of Egypt's Bank of Alexandria, but is currently an executive with El-Mex Salines, according to the salt production company's website.

The Pierre hotel said in a statement it would "fully comply with the investigation". The hotel is owned by Indian company Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces.

The alleged attack comes after Strauss-Kahn resigned as managing director of the IMF on 18 May, after he was charged with sexually assaulting a maid at a different city hotel, the Sofitel, near Times Square.

Strauss-Kahn has denied the allegations, but is under house arrest and awaits trial.










It's not just countries and banks that are at the mercy of credit agencies. It's motorways too.

Standard & Poor's has just downgraded the senior debt in the €660m Limerick tunnel from BB+ to BBB- and placed it on "creditwatch negative".

The ink is barely drying on the debt, but S&P is right to be worried.

At the time of opening last July, the tunnel was proudly declared the biggest infrastructural project ever in the mid-west region - rivalled only by the construction of the hydroelectric power station at Ardnacrusha during the early 1930s.

But who would have thought? Truck drivers are just unwilling to pay the €5.70 to travel the short 11km under the Shannon - 90% of them are using alternative routes.

S&P has picked up on this and believes the tunnel will remain on state aid for the duration of the 35 year private management concession.

"Toll revenues are currently substantially lower than we forecast.

"As a result, the project is heavily reliant on the guarantee from the
Irish National Roads Authority (NRA), the concession grantor. In our
view, it is likely that this will remain the case for most of the
remaining life of the 35-year concession," said the agency.

Hauliers say they have tried in vain to negotiate with Direct Route, the partnership between Allied Irish Banks, Sisk the builders and others."They have no incentive to drop their price because their agreement with the NRA means the taxpayer will make up the difference," said Eoin Gavin president of the Irish Road Haulage Association.

Few outside Limerick or the trucking community will be perturbed by S&P's analysis.

But the tunnel is a metaphor for Ireland's approach to difficult times ¨C
overborrow, then tax the life out of the economy because you can (nobody is squealing). There are no protests a la Spain yet, but they may well yet come.

Skipping meals to get by

Take last night's Primetime Investigates on RTE which showed that 82% of carers have been affected by the cutbacks in state health care and many families are living in poverty as a result.

'Families are literally skipping meals to keep their heads above
water. Viewers may be shocked by the report's findings but the Carers
Association is already aware that this kind of hardship is commonplace
for many family carers," said Catherine Cox, spokeswoman for the
Carers Association.

The programme shocked viewers.

"Why is anyone surprised by tonight's #rtept? Hello, good evening and
welcome to reality," asked @leotraynor on Twitter.

"Because of cutbacks, how many will carry that epitaph to their grave?" asked @jenoconnell.

"I'd like to think those to blame for the mess we're in are watching
#rtept and hanging their heads in shame. They're not though," said Irish Times journalist @conor_pope.

Conor is right. Ireland is now turning into a new phase of denial. In 07 and 08 it ignored the fact the world was crumbling around it with the credit crunch. Even the Central Bank predicted a 'soft landing'.

Bailout, what bailout? Ireland in denial again

Now the politicians and bankers are at it again.

Yesterday the taoiseach and the finance minister Michael
Noonan both denied that Ireland was, like Greece, heading for another
bailout after renegade member of the Irish parliament Leo Varadkar stated the obvious and said Ireland might not be able to return to the markets next year because of the punitive cost of borrowing (two-year bonds hit 12.5% on Friday).

"Let me clarify for you again: there will be no need for a second bailout for Ireland in 2012," warned Enda Kenny.

Politicians trying to prove to Europe they are behaving, would not be expected to say anything else, but at this stage the public is educated enough to know neither Noonan or Kenny will decide the country's fate. The markets will.

Stockbrokers Bloxham referring to the latest storm about a possible second bail out told clients in a note: "Investors believe Ireland will be unable to return to the market and instead will have to tap the European Union's permanent rescue fund in 2013, which might require some restructuring of privately held sovereign debt." Clear enough.

Even the former deputy director of the IMF, Donal Donovan has said it
is the only way out of the crisis as Ireland's debt to GDP ratio runs
dangerously high.

"My own best guess is that around 2013, if not sooner, ( though I
wouldn't put up to a 50% [chance] on a sooner), there will be
some element of sovereign debt rescheduling," Donovan said last month.

Need it be any clearer?

Kenny and Noonan are, unlike the Greeks, afraid to point a financial missile at the ECB at this point in time and will rigidly stick to the good boy routine. Indeed a small country like Ireland will have to take its lead from the ECB and won't be able to go solo with its finances.

If the ECB cuts a deal with Greece as it is expected to do, then a new deal with Ireland will surely follow.

The European Central Bank will eventually come around to the idea of writing off some of Ireland's debt, Donovan believes, because by 2013 external agencies like the IMF were "likely" to deem Ireland's debt to GDP "unsustainable". Ireland's debt to GDP ratio is expected to rise to between 115 and 120% in 2013/14.

"The IMF has no problem with the principle of debt rescheduling," said Donovan. It's just the ECB that are dithering.







In response to mass unemployment and the prospect of having to emigrate, an unemployed Irish graduate has spent €2,000 (¡ê1,745) on a massive billboard advertisement asking employers not to let him leave the republic.

F¨¦ilim Mac An Iomaire, who erected an advertising hoarding on the busy Merrion Road in south Dublin in an attempt to find a job, has said he has been overwhelmed by the response.

The ad contains a picture of the 26-year-old marketing graduate facing a number of famous landmarks from Sydney, London and New York with the message: "Save me from emigration."

His ad has struck a chord across Ireland at a time when about 50,000 citizens, many of them young graduates, are expected to leave this year for work abroad. There are still up to 400,000 jobless workers in Ireland due to the property crash and the country's fiscal crisis.

Mac An Iomaire said he came up with the idea after being unemployed for eight months after a year in Australia.

"I had a good bit of money saved when I came home from Australia but I was managing to live on jobseeker's allowance. I gave it a week of hard thinking to come up with the concept and nothing was going to stop me then," he said.

"The great thing is that everyone's been so positive about it. No one has really had a bad word to say.

"Everybody who is close to me knows I've been pretty miffed about being unemployed and feeling like I've been on the sidelines."

Mac An Iomaire also set up a Facebook page and Twitter account, @Joblesspaddy, and has been inundated with emails and messages.

"I've had some really nice replies. Some CV experts are willing to spruce up my CV so I'm pretty overwhelmed with that," he said.

"It looks good for something to come out of it, anyway.

"I am not exactly looking for a concrete job offer. I would sooner go through the whole process of doing an interview," he added.










A celebrity weatherman has been acquitted of rape charges, judges said, after a high-profile trial that captivated the German media and public over the last year.

J?rg Kachelmann, a 52-year-old TV weatherman, denied the charges by state prosecutors that he raped his former girlfriend, 37, at knifepoint in February 2010 just before he flew to Canada to work at the Vancouver Winter Olympics.

Kachelmann, a Swiss national, was arrested at Frankfurt airport on returning, leading to a case that stunned Germany. Details of his private life have filled newspaper columns and TV news broadcasts since.

Prosecutors had demanded a prison term for Kachelmann of four years and three months. His defence lawyer argued it was consensual sex.

"There was no other verdict that this court could reach," the weatherman's lawyer, Johann Schwenn, told reporters afterwards. "Mr Kachelmann has been treated in a most shabby fashion."

Kachelmann is Germany's top weatherman and famed for his rumpled appearance and entertaining reports. His trial had dominated its media for the last nine months.

Kachelmann admitted he was not monogamous but denied charges he raped the 37-year-old radio host. But that failed to dampen the interest of papers and public alike over reports of his private life.

Kachelmann said he had consensual sex just before the girlfriend discovered he was having an affair and ended their relationship. Prosecutors said he raped her at knifepoint after she learned of the affair.

Media coverage has included reports claiming he was seeing 14 different women simultaneously.








Polish women living in Britain have on average more children than their young compatriots back in their home country. When the largest Polish daily Gazeta Wyborcza broke this story a few months ago, it was a huge ¨C but not entirely unexpected ¨C surprise.

A lot of comments reflected a deep chasm between the Polish public discourse and our social reality. The "west" was supposed to be liberal, even libertine, and because of that very dangerous and corrupting place for young people. But children? They don't fit this narrative. Every few weeks, some conservative politician sounds the alarm about the disastrous demographic situation of the nation. Polish women have only 1.23 children on average: this is very bad news for the future of the country.

The explanations offered for the low birth rate have largely been ideological. It has been blamed on the young generation's hedonism, permissive and oversexualised popular culture, and their lack of patriotism. So when it turned out that the real reasons might be much more prosaic ¨C substandard social services, poor and often unavailable medical care, lack of jobs for parents and nurseries for children, expensive housing ¨C the commentariat was uncomfortable. Suddenly, the fact that UK-based Polish women had more children than immigrants from Bangladesh was an example of dismal failure of social policy at home.

The uncomfortable truth is that the most educated generation in Poland's history ¨C almost half of 25-year-olds are university graduates ¨C has to make do with a terrible job market. This is not solely due to the global economic crisis: Poland only experienced a period of slower growth, not GDP decline. Despite this, the future for most young Poles is far from bright ¨C the nation that paid a lot to educate them does not need them on the job market, and has no idea what to do with them: the official unemployment rate for university graduates hovers around 20%. Those who manage to get a job are equally frustrated ¨C they feel they are working below their qualifications, often in "McJobs" with no career path, and very often have to earn a large part of their salary unofficially to avoid taxes ¨C which makes, for example, getting a mortgage difficult. There is virtually no job security; employers feel it is a buyers' market and think they can always find a better (read: more "malleable") employee. They are slow to hire, and eager to fire.

For most western Europeans, this is a well-known picture. In Spain, the graduate unemployment rate is twice as high as in Poland. What makes Poland different is the high levels of emigration, and the complete absence of a protest movement ¨C which makes it easy for politicians to be silent on the issue, or give phony ideological explanations.

Part of the problem is structural. In the low-tech Polish economy, which is dominated by small, family-owned firms, there is precious little work for educated people at all. In recent weeks, the newspaper I work for published a letter from a young law graduate working on her PhD. She couldn't get a job that made use of her degree. When she tried to become an office assistant, the would-be boss wrote to her explaining that he expected her to become his lover, adding, "if you don't accept that, don't reply to my email ¨C I don't care what you think". Now try to imagine 50,000 humanities graduates ¨C we produce that many every year ¨C in this kind of job market.

Perhaps the most important issue is our inefficient state and its greying, disconnected political class. Two of the largest political parties are led by men in their 50s and 60s, who grew up fighting communism. They pay lip service to the problems of the youth, but not much more. The solutions that the state can offer ¨C some tax cuts for employers giving jobs to graduates ¨C are also woefully inadequate. The state apparatus is both bloated and famously ineffective: the government recently admitted that paying 50 zlotys in social security costs about 100 zlotys in administrative expenses. Little wonder there is no money for youth-oriented social programmes . No wonder they are leaving Poland. According to recent research, in 2009, 1.8 to 2.4 million Poles, most of them young, were working abroad. Despite the crisis in the west, they don't seem to come back.

Our politicians may say "we don't want our youth in London, we want them in Poland". In reality, every time they say so, they breathe a sigh of relief. They are happy that young people are gone: no protests, no crime, no problem. Some of them are even sending money home.








The man who was on course to become Ireland and Europe's first openly gay president has described as "sabotage" the re-emergence of a nine-year-old interview in which he made controversial remarks about paedophilia.

The comments by senator David Norris, made in an interview in 2002, resurfaced in the Irish press on Monday, seriously damaging his chances of succeeding Mary McAleese to the Irish presidency. He had been ahead in all opinion polls in the race until this point.

In 2002 Norris told the current affairs magazine Magill: "I haven't the slightest interest in children, or in people who are considerably younger than me.

"I cannot understand how anybody could find children of either sex in the slightest bit attractive sexually ... but in terms of classic paedophilia, as practised by the Greeks, for example, where it is an older man introducing a younger man to adult life, there can be something said for it. Now, again, this is not something that appeals to me.

"Although, when I was younger, I would have greatly relished the prospect of an older, attractive, mature man taking me under his wing, lovingly introducing me to sexual realities, treating me with affection, teaching me about life."

Republication of the comments pose a challenge to Norris and how he handles the fallout may determine if he gets on the presidential ticket at all. Supporters of Norris admitted to being worried and said he would have to "clean up" the controversy if he hoped to secure a nomination.

Norris said on Tuesday that there had been a clear attempt to sabotage his bid to become Ireland's president. If elected Norris has vowed to challenge homophobia around the world and promised to confront the leaders of regimes who persecute gay people.

Norris described the republication of the interview as part of a smear campaign. He said that those who were circulating it should be ashamed of themselves. Norris described to RTE's Pat Kenny radio show how the story had re-emerged as an "inaccurate misleading misquotation".

Responding to questions from Kenny, Norris said: "I answered all the questions ¨C on radio and in every newspaper ¡­ and now, Pat, that Magill article is being sent to all the [county] councillors in an attempt to prevent me from getting the nomination." He added that he abhorred any sexual contact with children, and opposed paedophilia and incest in all its forms.

In an earlier statement Norris said that, in the original interview he had "engaged in an academic discussion about classical Greece and sexual activity in a historical context. It was a hypothetical, intellectual conversation which should not have been seen as a considered representation of my views on some of the issues discussed over dinner.

"People should judge me on my record and actions as a public servant, over the last 35 years and on the causes and campaigns, for which I have fought, and not on an academic conversation with a journalist over dinner. I did not ever and would not approve of the finished article as it appeared," he said.

The journalist who conducted the original interview rang the Pat Kenny show live on air to defend her article. Helen Lucy Burke contested Norris's claim that she had continually turned her tape recorder on and off during the interview. Burke said she had amended a draft of her article in Magill before publication to allow for Norris's suggestions.

She said she still had a cassette tape of the interview although she could not find a machine to play back her recording.

In response to the journalist's call in to the radio show, Norris wrote on Twitter that he was "extremely grateful" for all the support he had received across Ireland. He stressed that he did not want to see Burke "personally attacked over her role in the furore.

The senator is seeking nomination from 20 MPs and senators or the backing of four city and county councils to obtain the nomination for the Irish presidency. In a fortnight, he will address three councils in one day, which he has described as "Super Monday". Last week an opinion poll in the Sunday Independent found 44% of those polled wanted Norris to succeed McAleese.

Apart from being a longstanding advocate of gay rights in Ireland and abroad, Norris is a renowned James Joyce scholar who has written several works on the author of Dubliners and Ulysses. He also campaigned to save Georgian parts of central Dublin from property developers.








Judges have rejected an appeal by war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic seeking to stop his extradition to a UN tribunal, a prosecutor said.

The former Bosnian Serb commander will be extradited to The Hague "as soon as possible", Serbia's deputy war crimes prosecutor, Bruno Vekaric, told the Associated Press.

The timing depends on when the Serbian justice minister signs an extradition order, but that is expected to be done quickly, paving the way for Mladic's immediate handover.

Mladic is charged at the tribunal for atrocities committed by his Serb troops during Bosnia's 1992-1995 war, including the notorious Srebrenica massacre that left 8,000 Muslim men and boys dead.

Earlier on Tuesday, he was briefly released from the jail cell, travelling in a secret high-security convoy to a suburban cemetery where he left a lone candle for his daughter, Ana, who killed herself during Bosnia's bloody ethnic war.

Mladic, 69, was accompanied by a convoy of armoured vehicles, Vekaric said.

"We didn't announce his visit to the grave because it is his private thing and because it represented a security risk. The whole operation lasted for exactly 22 minutes and passed without a glitch. He was at the grave for a few minutes."

Europe's most-wanted war crimes suspect could be handed over to the tribunal in The Hague as soon as late Tuesday or early Wednesday, officials said. A defence extradition appeal sent by mail arguing he is not mentally and physically fit to stand trial arrived at the Belgrade court on Tuesday.

Mladic was arrested on Thursday in a village north of the Serbian capital after 16 years on the run.

His 23-year-old daughter Ana, a medical student, killed herself in 1994 with her father's gun. She reportedly did not leave a note, but reports at the time said she ended her life at Mladic's Belgrade family house because of depression caused by his role in the war.

Mladic has rejected the official investigation into his case and claimed she was killed by his wartime enemies, saying the gun was found in her left hand, although she was right-handed.

Kadira Gabeljic, whose husband and two sons were killed in the Srebrenica massacre, condemned Mladic's grave-side visit, saying she almost fainted at the news.

So far, experts have managed to exhume only parts of her sons, Mesud and Meho, who were 16 and 21 when killed.

"He [Mladic] was allowed to do it, and I am still searching for my children for the past 16 years, ever since Srebrenica happened," she said.

"My husband had been found, but what about my children?" She asked. "I will wait for years. I might even die before their complete remains are found."

In addition to the appeal, Mladic's lawyer, Milos Saljic, had asked for a team of doctors to examine his client, who is said to have had at least two strokes.

Vekaric accused Mladic of using delaying tactics and said nothing should prevent his extradition to tribunal.

"Doctors are saying he's capable of standing trial," Vekaric said, adding that Mladic will get medical checkups once he arrives at the UN tribunal's detention unit in The Hague.

The prosecutor said no one would be informed when Mladic will be transported from his prison to the Netherlands "because of security risks".

On Monday, the Serbian president, Boris Tadic, rejected speculation that authorities had known of Mladic's hiding place and delayed his arrest to coincide with a visit by EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton. The rumours have persisted because Mladic was found living not far from Belgrade with relatives who share his last name.

"Any such comment makes no sense," Tadic said. "The truth is that we arrested Ratko Mladic the moment we discovered him."

The president also said it was time for the EU to do its part by boosting his country's efforts to join the bloc, arguing the arrest of Mladic proves it is serious about rejoining the international fold.

"I simply ask the EU to fulfil its part," he said. "We fulfilled our part and we will continue to do so."

The EU had repeatedly said Serbia could begin pre-membership talks only after it arrested the wartime Bosnian Serb commander. Some EU countries have said Serbia needs to do more, including arresting its last fugitive, Goran Hadzic, who led Croatian Serb rebels during the 1991-1995 war.

Tadic said Hadzic would be arrested as soon as possible.









Russian authorities have detained the main suspect in the killing of the investigative journalist and Kremlin critic Anna Politkovskaya, according to Russian media reports on Tuesday.

Rustam Makhmudov, the man accused of shooting Politkovskaya in 2006, was detained in the province of Chechnya, according to a lawyer, Murad Musayev, whose comments were reported by Ekho Moskvy radio.

Politkovskaya, who investigated rights abuses in Chechnya and high-level corruption across Russia, was gunned down in her apartment building in a killing that sparked outrage worldwide.

According to the Interfax news agency, an unidentified law enforcement official said Makhmudov would be brought to Moscow for questioning.

Two of Makhmudov's brothers, Dzhabrail and Ibragim, were acquitted in 2009 along with a third man tried for Politkovskaya's murder. Rustam Makhmudov avoided capture and had remained at large.







The negotiations on Croatia's accession to the European Union are almost complete, but member countries were divided on the issue when they met in Brussels last week.

Croatia started talks almost six years ago, at the same time as Turkey, but has made better progress. However, a group of countries led by France are refusing to set a date for the end of talks, with attention focusing on reform to the judiciary and state support for shipyards.

France, the UK and the Netherlands want a system for supervising Croatia's track record between now and the time it actually joins, once the various member states have ratified the treaty on accession.

Above all Paris wants safeguards to prevent Croatia joining the passport-free Schengen area too soon, particularly if problems persist with its legal system and migrants. It hopes that pressure will encourage Zagreb "to sustain its efforts", once negotiations are complete, according to the French minister for European affairs, Laurent Wauquiez. Failure to comply would delay accession.

This is a view endorsed by Holland. "We need to be sure progress is lasting and irreversible," said the Dutch foreign minister, Uri Rosenthal. The aim is to learn from previous mistakes. Romania and Bulgaria, which gained membership in 2009, are still struggling to contain corruption and their legal systems are shaky.

Those backing Croatia are afraid France may be stalling, yielding to pressure at home from the far right to prevent the entry of any new members before the presidential election next year. The Swedish foreign minister, Carl Bildt, saw no need for safeguards. His Italian counterpart, Franco Frattini, appealed to Europe to acknowledge that Croatia was ready to make the final preparations.








Three massive carp are floundering in a pool in the middle of the yard as Balazs Barkuti prepares to cut them up, in keeping with the strict rules set for Danube fishers. This evening his family hotel is expecting 17 visitors from Budapest. They will be staying in Baja, overlooking the island of the same name in southern Hungary, 150km from the capital. Here hal¨¢szl¨¦, or fisherman's soup, is a must, to such an extent that a great stewpot hangs at the entrance to the picturesque town.

In summer, the Baja fish-soup festival attracts hordes of visitors to the town and to the nearby Gemenc national park. People here are said to eat more fish ¨C 66kg a year on average ¨C than anywhere else in Europe.

The nature reserve, with its many islands and quiet inlets, is still in more or less the same state as before the great river was regulated. The park is renowned for its century-old willows and great oaks, its black storks, trees and red deer.

"Ever since I was a child I have dreamt of living here," says Barkuti, 32. "The island hasn't changed in 100 years and I want it to stay the way it is for my two children to enjoy." Barkuti's dream came true five years ago when he left Budapest and a job stuck in front of a computer. "I enjoyed the excitement of the city but after a while I'd had enough," he says. "There aren't many places in the world you can find the peace and quiet we have here on the banks of the Danube."

However, in the course of its 2,850km journey across Europe, from the Black Forest in Germany to the Black Sea in Romania, the river suffers a great deal. Dams and reservoirs have damaged its reputation as a natural waterway, pollution and waste have soiled its water. Last year, toxic sludge was released into the Danube after a dam burst at an alumina plant. "In the morning I hear a series of tiny explosions," Barkuti says. "The reed beds along the river bank trap the plastic bottles as they float past. When the sun heats them up, they go pop!"

In September 2009, Hungary and Croatia agreed to protect the area between the Danube and the rivers Mura and Drava. This set in motion a process that culminated at the end of March when the first two countries were joined by Austria, Slovenia and Serbia. Together they established a trans-border Unesco biosphere reserve to protect Europe's Amazon, a scheme that the green campaigning group WWF had been advocating for about 10 years.

The new protected area extends over five countries, along 700km of river, and encompasses some 800,000 hectares of unique natural and historic landscape. It is Europe's largest riverine protected area.

The reserve is home to white-tailed sea eagles ¨C with Europe's highest concentration of nesting pairs ¨C and other endangered species such as little terns, black storks and sturgeon. It is also a vital stopover for more than 250,000 migrating birds.

"The rare species we see here know nothing about borders," says Tibor Parrag, head of nature conservation at the Danube-Drava national park. "It was essential to create a nature reserve to protect biodiversity. The agreement signed by the five countries will act as a catalyst for all of us."

This seems to suit local residents. Every year some 50,000 visitors flock to Baja (population 40,000). Cross-border protection of the Danube secures the region's future as a tourist destination. "Apart from tropical rainforest, there is no equivalent in terms of biodiversity to these flooded lowlands," says Arno Mohl, the Mura-Drava-Danube biosphere reserve project leader at WWF Austria. "The reserve will also play a key role in promoting eco-tourism. We hope the agreement will put an end to unsustainable schemes to regulate the rivers, as well as sand and gravel dredging, which still threatens this exceptional river ecosystem."

Under the European Union strategy for the Danube, decided on 13 April, which places considerable emphasis on environmental improvements, funding will be redirected to the nature reserve, which has yet to receive the Unesco seal of approval.

Along the riverfront in Baja the cafe terraces are packed. Barkuti is welcoming his guests, who have just arrived. He promises them a candle-lit dinner on the terrace overlooking his garden. "There was a time when we could drink the water from the Danube and use it for making soup," he says.

"I don't know if that'll be possible in the future, but if we stop throwing all our rubbish in the river, the fish will be pleased. And it make no sense dividing up the Danube with borders. The river will have a future if the countries join forces to protect it. The pact they've just signed is a good start."








Recently on this site, Mark Lawson questioned the health of the documentary, hoping that "traditional observational or historical documentaries still exist". In the former eastern bloc countries, where metaphorical writing was the only way of bamboozling the censors, the genre is not just existing, but thriving, for now there is the opportunity (and information) to tell it as it is, and was. In doing so, the documentary form is being revitalised.

Last week, the 51st Krak¨®w film festival, devoted entirely to short films and documentaries, screened 223 films, including 132 documentaries. Hosted in the beautiful Polish city, the festival was staged in four cinemas themselves revealing something of the country's history: the Kino Pod Baranami, which won the 2009 best programming award (Europa cinemas) and is housed in the upper floors of a gothic palace in the city's crowded main square (as is Kino Ars) to the communist-era, 824-seat Kij¨®w Centrum, and the tiny Kino Mikro, tucked away on the ground floor of a residential block outside the centre. Even with variable sound quality and occasional blips, the viewing experience was enhanced by these intriguing locations.

With 22 prizes up for grabs, the Golden Horn award for best film director was won by Wojciech Star¨®n (surely destined to join the ranks of the Polish greats, Kie?lowski and Wajda) for his poetically shot The Argentinian Lesson. His film tenderly probes the life of a Polish family living in South America, and in particular, the friendship between their small son and the girl next door. Indeed, documentaries about the family and its dispersal through migration seemed to dominate the festival, with a new generation of film-makers drawing on their parents' archive of home movies from the 1980s and 90s. Such is the case with Israeli director Tomer Heymann's The Queen Has No Crown, a punning title that alludes to the mother of a family as her sons emigrate to the US from Israel, and to the son who tells her he's gay. It's a warm piece of work but a little too long.

More successful is a shrewdly edited short by Marcel ?ozi¨½ski, a former Oscar nominee for his 1993 documentary 89mm from Europe. Tonia and Her Children shows the effect on two elderly siblings when they discover their mother was a Jewish communist tortured by the party. We see them, incredulous, reading her letters, reports by her torturers, her forced confessions, and again, some original footage. The result is harrowing and heartrending and, for all its simplicity, an extraordinary achievement.

Another family tragedy takes place in the festival's best animated film, 1989 (When I Was Five Years Old) by Danish director Thor Ochsner. Combining moody photography shot on an iPad, with animations sketched over scenes from YouTube, held together by well-timed voiceover narration, this piece achieves a stunning intensity in its tale of a car crash in which the director (a rear-seat passenger) lost his father.

Bringing humour to the festival's prevalent themes of family rupture and exile was the best short film winner, 1994, by Iran-born director Kaveh Tehrani, reflecting on the year Lillehammer in Norway staged the winter Olympics, through the eyes of Dariush, an Iranian immigrant recreating a little bit of Persia in the basement of his home. Blurring the boundary between fact and fiction, the documentary plays with expectations to come up with a film about cultural identity that's both funny and thought provoking.

The festival also focused on Dutch documentaries, of which I particularly enjoyed Among Horses and Men by Marjoleine Boonstra. Prison inmates in the Nevada desert on a rehabilitation programme learn to break-in horses. It is a sensitive portrait even if the tough men/wild horses parallel is a little overdone. Another series, Somewhere in Europe, was remarkable for Srdjan Sarenac's A Village Without Women, a laugh-out-loud yet respectful study of the lives of three Serbian brothers in the mountains; one of the brothers wants to travel to Albania to find a wife, but he doesn't have a passport or even a birth certificate. It's a beautifully shot, well-balanced film, with an embracing sense of humour, once again posing questions about identity, national and personal.

Polish documentaries are in rude health, with Piotr Bernas's Paparazzi following a tough guy doing everything it takes to get his pictures, until the Lech Kaczy¨½ski plane crash makes him question his conscience, while Marta Minorowicz's charming if slightly studied Decrescendo features a gay man working in an old people's home, where he develops a close relationship with an ex-ballerina. Significantly, both directors attended the Andrzej Wajda Master School of Film Directing.

There was time, too, for a retrospective of films by the great animator Piotr Kamler, who won a festival Dragon of Dragons for his De Chirico-like figures; it's well worth investigating his works Chronopolis, The Hole, and Green Planet. The same can be said for the late Wojciech Has, whose enchanting adaptations of classic Polish novels such as The Hourglass Sanatorium and The Saragossa Manuscript have gained cult status.

Improving each year, the Krak¨®w film festival will soon be up there with the best documentary and short-film showcases of Europe: in Clermont-Ferrand, Leipzig, Winterthur, and next week Sheffield. The festival showed clearly that the documentary is not an ailing genre, but one that's forever trying out new forms or reinventing old ones (like those home movies). In this respect, it can be argued that the documentary is the form that can give us the best sense of that other family, the so-called new Europe, and that's even more pertinent in Poland's case as it takes up EU presidency on 1 July. What's more, as Tonia and Her Children showed, a simple revelation of facts can still be the most compelling.








The suggestion made in England that the Entente Cordiale should be converted into a definite Anglo-French alliance has naturally attracted much attention here. The tone of the press comments is on the whole one of friendly caution; an article by M Gabriel Hanotaux, in the Figaro, is fairly representative of them. M Hanotaux is not an Anglophile, and his policy when Minister of Foreign Affairs was hostile to England, but he seems to think that an alliance, if it were possible, would be preferable to the existing Entente, which he has always disliked on the ground that it is deceptive and leaves the mutual relations and engagements of the two countries in a state of ambiguity. But he recognises the possible dangers of such an alliance, and the writers who receive the suggestion with more cordiality than he make much the same reservations.

The "Temps" says that it is for each country to examine the matter from its own point of view and carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of a formal treaty. Other papers of different political shades say much the same thing as the "Temps," some of them more explicitly. The general conclusion to be drawn from the comments of the Parisian press is that apart from all political objections, France would welcome an alliance with England only if England were able to give her effective military support on the Continent in the event of war. And it seems to be the general opinion that in present conditions England could not give such support. This means, in plain words, that a necessary condition of an Anglo-French alliance would be compulsory military service in England.

It is the fact that enthusiasm for the Franco-Russian alliance has considerably cooled that gains such support as there is in France for the idea of an alliance with England. Distrust of Russia is steadily increasing, and nobody believes the official assurances that the relations between the allies are as cordial as ever. As usual, the press has been muzzled, and there has been little comment on the Russian intrigues against Turkey, but what little has become known has created a very bad impression. Moreover, the Russian alliance was made when the Nationalist movement was at its height. The decline of Nationalism has brought about a natural dislike of an alliance with a despotic power. There is at present in France a sincere and widespread sympathy with England, due to a recognition of the fact that England and France are the two great democratic Powers of Europe.










If every epoch has to have a defining question, something that characterises the feeling of the time, then ours is: Cui bono? Who benefits? Arising somehow from the ashes of trust in Westminster and a disquiet with a globalisation no one can control, we, culturally, seem happier and happier to explain the causes of events by looking to who benefits from them.

Dominique Strauss-Kahn's arrest in New York is a case in point. The story whipped up a media frenzy as political analysts, philosophers, psychologists and even psychoanalysts were rolled out to debate the various aspects of the case. What was most interesting was the speed at which discussions about who would benefit most from DSK's downfall took centre stage. It was as if this was the magical key to unlocking the truth.

Evidence was in short supply, yet commentators pointed the finger of blame at the Sarkozy camp, the Americans and even the Russians. Everywhere, in fact, except at the man himself. Regional councillor Mich¨¨le Sabban went all-out and denounced it as an "international conspiracy" to bring down the former head of the IMF. And the media fallout was reflected in the public sphere: polls in France revealed that almost 60% of the population agreed that DSK was the victim of a conspiracy.

The DSK case is only the tip of the iceberg, the latest in a long parade of conspiracy theories that have queued up for their share of airtime and column inches. The recent "birther" theory, for example, supported by over 20% of Americans, holds that Barack Obama was not born in the US and forged his birth certificate. Then there are those who don't believe in the recent killing of Osama bin Laden. These ¨C let's call them the "deathers" ¨C hold that perhaps he has been dead and kept on ice for the last 10 years, hidden "behind the frozen peas and oven chips" until it was politically opportune to defrost him (this one got airtime on Russia Today).

To the "deathers" we can, of course, add the "truthers" ¨C those who believe that the US government caused or allowed the attacks on 9/11 (to replace the bogeyman of the USSR as a way to control the public and pave the way to Iraq). A 2008 poll put the number of people who thought al-Qaida was behind the 9/11 attacks at 16% in Egypt, 11% in Jordan and 32% in China. Only a bare majority ¨C 57% ¨C thought so in the UK. These powerful ideas bounce around to all the corners of the internet before the government can "strongly reject¡­".

But there is a serious point here. Conspiracy theorists are not typically driven by a dispassionate search for truth. Conspiracy theories have become an attractive, addictive habit, offering a comforting explanation for an increasingly complex, mysterious world. For those who are distant from the great decisions and the powerful people that shape our lives, there is a mystique that allows little room for coincidence or accident. They can offer social status, too. Conspiracy theorists often set themselves up as heroic defenders of life, liberty and truth. The well-known YouTube conspiricists compete to break the next scandal to stay ahead. Conspiracy websites sell T-shirts emblazoned with "You Are the Resistance", "Legalise Freedom" and "Tyranny Response Team" (for only $20, you too can join the crusade to smash corporate interests).

There is some truth to the claim that conspiracy theories exist because conspiracies exist. No doubt some do: during Operation Northwoods in 1963 the US joint chiefs of staff discussed (but never implemented) manufacturing a false Cuban terror campaign in the US as a reason for war. In 1973, the CIA was involved in a coup against the democratically elected Chilean leader Salvador Allende. And the CIA's Project MKULTRA, involving universities, hospitals and pharma companies, did indeed attempt to manipulate mental states through the secret administration of drugs, hypnosis and isolation to unknowing patients.

Conspiracy theories view certain events as the work of a hidden, powerful elite that secretly influence world affairs while concealing their interests, irrespective of the available evidence. In exposing these conspiracies, one question above all others directs their efforts: who benefits? When world events seem the marionettes of the "powers that be" (read: a cabal of Bilderburg, Zionist, Masonic, CIA, Mossad, government, Bond villain superplotters ¨C delete as appropriate), when everything is connected, nothing is as it seems and interest reigns supreme, this is a logic that seems the most sensible, the most relevant.

If, despite all evidence, we start explaining all events by cui bono, the world suddenly becomes perhaps a little darker, a little more treacherous and frankly a lot simpler and straightforward than it ought to be. We often find that the facts are crowbarred into a world view that has little time for things that aren't conspiracies.

We should be agnostics to the question, rather than its high priests and priestesses. The problem is when people's distrust becomes a kneejerk reaction of any official line, regardless of the evidence. Presuming there is a plot in every case is as myopic and frankly silly as presuming there isn't. When the next big story breaks, let's not lose our scepticism about the powers that be, but let's not become dyed-in-the-wool cynics either.









The mystery E coli outbreak that has killed 16 people escalated into a pan-European row on Tuesday as Germany admitted that tainted Spanish cucumbers were not the source of the outbreak after all.

Spain's minister for agriculture of the Andalusian regional government, Clara Aguilera, ate a homegrown cucumber on live television as she railed against a suggestion by Hamburg scientists last week that Iberian cucumbers were likely to blame for the outbreak, which claimed its first non-German victim on Thursday when a Swedish woman died shortly after returning from Germany.

"Germany accused Spain of being responsible for the E coli contamination in Germany, and it did it with no proof, causing irreparable damage to the Spanish production sector," said Spain's agriculture minister Rosa Aguilar.

French health minister Xavier Bertrand demanded greater transparency from Spain and Germany after three people in France became ill.

More than 1,000 people have been infected, 373 of whom are seriously ill.

Spanish farmers say fear of their produce is spreading in Europe. Customers are cancelling orders, and farm workers are being laid off in a country with 21% unemployment.

Some 150,000 tons of Spanish fruit and vegetables are piling up every week, with losses running at €200m (¡ê175m) a week, according to Fepex, Spain's fruit and vegetable export body.

Spanish media reported that Germany, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Luxembourg, Hungary, Sweden, Belgium and Russia have been banning Spanish cucumbers after what scientists say is one of the largest E coli outbreaks.

Spain would be demanding compensation for all European vegetable producers who had experienced losses because of the health scare, said Aguilar.

Within hours of her eating cucumber on television, the German agriculture secretary Robert Kloos said at an EU farm ministers meeting in Hungary: "Germany recognises that the Spanish cucumbers are not the cause."

Earlier, Spanish vegetable growers accused German authorities of covering up the real cause of the outbreak and asked the prime minister, Jos¨¦ Luis Rodr¨ªguez Zapatero, to intervene. Hospital authorities in the northern Spanish city of San Sebasti¨¢n said they were investigating a suspected case of E coli in a patient who recently returned from Germany.

The source of the virulent strain of the bacteria is still not known, but scientists said the suspicions about vegetables or salads were well-founded since cattle manure used in fertiliser can harbour E coli. Hamburg's state health minister, Cornelia Pr¨¹fer-Storcks, who was the first official to point the finger at Spain last Thursday, has insisted that she was right to go public with preliminary test results from the Hamburg institute for hygiene and environment suggesting Spanish cucumbers were the source.

"It would have been irresponsible to withhold a well-founded suspicion given the high number of illnesses. Protecting life is more important than protecting financial interests," she said.But Pr¨¹fer-Storcks said tests on two cucumbers had found a different strain of E coli from that carried by patients in the city.

European Union officials have said the cucumbers could have been contaminated at any point along the route from Spain to Germany.

As bickering continues, the death toll rises. In Boras, Sweden, authorities announced the death of woman in her 50s who was admitted on 29 May after a trip to Germany. In Paderborn, Germany, the local council said an 87-year-old woman who also had other ailments had died. One American tourist has also been hospitalised in the Czech Republic with symptoms of E coli infection after also visiting Germany.

The national disease control centre in Germany said 373 people were sick with the most serious form of the outbreak, hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a rare complication arising from an infection most commonly associated with E coli. That figure was up from the 329 reported on Monday.

Susanne Glasmacher, a spokeswoman for the Robert Koch Institute, said another 796 people have been affected by the bacteria making a total of more than 1,150 people infected. Germany's federal institute for risk assessment is still warning consumers in northern Germany to avoid all cucumbers, lettuces and raw tomatoes.

The European court of human rights has rejected a claim by imprisoned Russian oil magnate Mikhail Khodorkovsky that his arrest and trial were politically motivated. The court, however, ruled that Khodorkovsky's rights were violated during his arrest in 2003 and detention and awarded him damages.

Khodorkovsky, who was Russia's richest person at the time of his arrest, had funded opposition parties and was seen as a potential political threat to then president Vladimir Putin. Supporters have contended his prosecution for tax evasion and fraud was punishment for challenging the Kremlin.

The European court's rejection of that contention appears to be a significant setback to efforts by Khodorkovsky's supporters to portray him as a prisoner of conscience. He is due for release in 2016.

The court said the charges against Khodorkovsky caused "reasonable suspicion" but added that his legal team did not present "incontestable proof" of political motivation in the case. "Khodorkovsky's political opponents or business competitors might have benefited from his detention" but this "should not have been an obstacle for the authorities to prosecute him if there were serious charges against him", the court said.

Khodorkovsky's lawyer, Karinna Moskalenko, said her client was satisfied with the ruling, although he has yet to decide whether to lodge an appeal. Moskalenko said evidence of political motivation behind Khodorkovsky's prosecution had "significantly increased" since the first application to the European court and the defence team was hoping the court would uphold it in the applications that they were working on now.

The next claim to be heard by the court contests a decision to send Khodorkovsky to serve his term in a Siberian jail. Russian law says a convict must be imprisoned in the region where he was convicted, unless there are no facilities available.

Lyudmila Alexeyeva, a veteran rights activist and chair of the Moscow Helsinki Group, told the Interfax news agency that she was disappointed by the court's decision.

The court's ruling referred to Khodorkovsky's first trial, which ended in 2005 when he was found guilty of tax evasion and sentenced to nine years in prison, later reduced by one year. Most observers and fellow businessmen tended to view it at the time as an example of selective justice, saying Khodorkovsky might indeed have used loopholes in the law to lower the tax burden, something most Russian businesses were doing at that time.

In a second trial that concluded last December, Khodorkovsky and business partner Platon Lebedev were convicted of stealing from Khodorkovsky's now liquidated Yukos oil company and sentenced to 13 years in prison, to run concurrently with his previous conviction. Unlike the previous case, the second trial was viewed widely as a political reprisal against Khodorkovsky and was criticised by rights groups and officials in the west. A Moscow appeals court upheld that conviction last week, though it reduced the sentences by a year. Amnesty International last week declared Khodorkovsky and Lebedev to be prisoners of conscience.

The European court's ruling leaves concerns about the rule of law in Russia unresolved. Also unclear is whether Khodorkovsky has any chance of success in his petition for early release, for which he is technically eligible, having served more than half his sentence.

Russian president Dmitry Medvedev said in May that Khodorkovsky "poses absolutely no danger to the society" if released. But Putin, who is now prime minister, has hinted that the oil tycoon might be liable for fresh charges, claiming on one occasion that Khodorkovsky had his hands in blood "up to the elbows".

The human rights court, sitting in Strasbourg, ordered Russia pay €24,000 (¡ê21,000) in damages to Khodorkovsky for rights violations, including being held in cramped and insanitary conditions, and for extending his pretrial detention without justification. Moskalenko said the money would be given to charity.

Khodorkovsky was arrested when special forces officers stormed his plane at the runway of a Siberian airport. He had been summoned to be a witness in a criminal case and his detention was initially justified for having failed to appear. However, the court said, within hours of his detention he was presented with a lengthy list of criminal charges.

"The speed with which the investigating authorities had acted suggested they had been prepared for such a development and had wanted Mr Khodorkovsky as a defendant and not as a simple witness. Therefore, his detention had been unlawful as it had been made with a purpose different from the one expressed," the court said.

His lawyers said on Monday that Khodorkovsky had filed for parole, saying he is eligible for early release since he has served half of his 13-year sentence.









Silvio Berlusconi went on trial in April. Photograph: Bogdan Cristel/Reuters
Silvio Berlusconi's lawyer half turned and waved a hand over the courtroom behind him. "It's all that stuff there," Niccol¨° Ghedini told the judge.

He was gesturing at five giant folders ¨C each more than a foot thick ¨C and seven boxes. Ribbons for bundling documents trailed out of the folders like unlit fuses.

The "stuff" covered a table the width of Milan's biggest courtroom;

and, as Ghedini revealed at what was meant to have been the first substantive hearing of the vice charges against Italy's prime minister, it formed a wall his lawyers hope will shield him from conviction.

In April, Berlusconi went on trial, charged with paying an underage prostitute and trying to cover up his alleged offence by abusing his position. He was arraigned without committal proceedings, and normally his trial would take a couple of months. After a first hearing devoted to technicalities, this was meant to be when it began in earnest.

But anyone expecting a parade of demimondaines sashaying to and from the witness stand to be quizzed on salacious details was in for a disappointment. Instead, there was Ghedini telling the judges that, buried in the wall of paper, were the grounds for 16 separate legal arguments that the trial should not even be taking place.

"This is all about stretching things out until 6 July," said Paolo Colonnello, co-author of a book on the case. "That's when the constitutional court has to decide on the admissibility of a petition by the Chamber of Deputies."

Italy's lower house, dominated by Berlusconi's followers, wants the trial heard elsewhere.

"If the appeal is admitted, then the judges will probably suspend the trial until the constitutional court reaches a decision. That could take up to a year," said Colonnello, whose book is entitled Sodom.

Ghedini is a cadaverous man who rarely smiles, perhaps aware that the effect is often more upsetting than uplifting. But on Tuesday he positively radiated bonhomie.

He shook hands with prosecution counsel before the hearing. And when he began speaking, and was immediately drowned out by a builder's drill, he joked that the same thing had happened the last time they were adversaries.

It was not to be the only boring noise in court, however, as he and his fellow-counsel, Piero Longo, launched into speeches dense with the dates of laws, and the numbers and letters of their clauses and sub-clauses.

Longo, in particular, speaks not only with inordinate circumlocution, but in a monotone that could usefully replace waterboarding as a means for extracting information from suspected terrorists.

Ahead of him, above the judges, was an allegorical mural featuring three women in the kind of skimpy outfits said to have been "de rigueur" at "bunga bunga" parties. One held a book marked Lex (law).

There were two other Latin words in the painting. Dux and Leader was displayed prominently in the middle. And, up in the top right-hand corner, barely discernible from the press benches, there was Veritas (truth).








General Francisco Franco is described as authoritarian not totalitarian in a favourable account by Professor Luis Su¨¢rez. Photograph: AP
Spain's royal academy of history has triggered a row after publishing a publicly funded dictionary of national biography which includes an admiring description of the country's bloodiest 20th-century figure, General Francisco Franco.

After 12 years' work and more than €6.5m (¡ê5.7m) in taxpayers' money, the first volumes of the encyclopaedia were unveiled last week only for readers to discover that the dictator's biography had been written by Professor Luis Su¨¢rez, an 86-year-old Franco apologist who is better known as a medievalist.

The entry describes how Franco "became famous for the cold courage which he showed in the field" while a young officer in Africa, and goes on to say that his brutal years in power saw him "set up a regime that was authoritarian, but not totalitarian."

But Su¨¢rez failed to mention the tens of thousands of people killed during the Francoist era and refused to describe him as a dictator, arguing he had been authoritarian rather than totalitarian.

"That is simply recreating the old propaganda in favour of Franco," said Juli¨¢n Casanova, a historian of 20th-century Spain.

"It is not serious to allow someone like this to write Franco's entry, when there are plenty of specialists on 20th-century Spain who can do it," he said. "It brings our whole profession into disrepute."

Su¨¢rez is an acquaintance of the Franco family and a senior figure in the Brotherhood of the Valley of the Fallen. The group, which takes its name from the controversial underground basilica where the dictator was buried in 1975, is actively opposed to the so-called "historical memory" movement in Spain, which has recently been searching for, and digging up, the mass graves of the victims of Francoist death squads.

For many years, Su¨¢rez was one of the few historians allowed by Franco's family to study the personal papers of the man most Spaniards recognise as having been the country's dictator for 36 years from 1939. In 2005, Su¨¢rez, after a career spent studying the 15th and 16th centuries, published a biography of the dictator.

"This is an objective study, with no value judgments," he told Spain's EFE news agency.

He claimed the term "dictator" was not used during Franco's lifetime. "An historian cannot use it," he said.

The head of the royal historical society, Gonzalo Anes, said it would not censor authors involved in the national biography project. "It is very difficult to achieve absolute objectivity," he said.

But the culture minister in Spain's socialist government, ¨¢ngeles Gonz¨¢lez-Sinde, called for the rewriting of those entries in the dictionary which "do not reflect reality" or "are not written with the objectivity required of academic studies".

Joan Saura, a leftwing Catalan deputy in parliament, has presented a motion for the 20 volumes published so far to be withdrawn. He said: "It is a recompilation of Spanish fascist thinking."

The dictionary also includes admiring profiles of former conservative prime minister Jos¨¦ Mar¨ªa Aznar and his former culture minister, Esperanza Aguirre, who provided the initial funds for the project.








Over the past two weeks, Italy has been transformed by the results of its local elections, the run-offs for which were held on Sunday and Monday. In particular, the loss by the ruling Popolo della Liberta (PDL) of the city of Milan ¨C Silvio Berlusconi's hometown ¨C after 18 years of solid centre-right administration, is considered by all sides to mark the beginning of the end of the Berlusconi era. The day after, the piazza of the Duomo was packed with anti-Berlusconi voters celebrating the change. "Thank you, Milan" is the underlying substance of the most shared messages on Facebook and Twitter as well.

The day after the ballots in Milan, Naples, Trieste and Cagliari, to name the four most important local contests in which the centre-left made a clean sweep, there has been a unanimous reaction among analysts and public opinion polls. This was not a ballot about the mayors and other local authorities, it was a ballot about Berlusconi.

Even the right wing admits the defeat: "A blow for Silvio" is the headline on Libero. An editorial in La Stampa sums it up thus: "The Cavaliere lost his magic."

In typical fashion Berlusconi was not in the country to respond. He made a sneering comment from Romania, where he is on an official trip, that he was "too busy to go to his own funeral". But it's a defensive joke, in which defeat is tacitly admitted. Even his interior minister Roberto Maroni, from the coalition party Lega Nord, says the electoral results are a slap in the face for Berlusconi. The Lega is evaluating the damage it may have suffered by sticking too closely to Silvio, and considering whether to detach itself from him in order not to lose touch with its base of northern separatists.

Of course, Berlusconi suffered even worse results in 2005, at the end of his first term, when he was beaten by Romano Prodi, but he recovered within two years and was re-elected. However, this time he seems worn out by all the scandals. And even the most optimistic members of the PDL are sceptical about a quick recovery, foreseeing a bumpy ride towards a possible national congress next year to nominate a successor to Berlusconi.

They hope postponing the problem until then will give Berlusconi a better chance to keep going until 2013, when his term in office ends naturally. But this is wishful thinking on the part of Berlusconi's supporters, because the opposition now seems finally to have found the courage to speak up. Pierluigi Bersani, leader of the Democratic party, is hoping to close this parliament with an emergency government, while the more leftist Nicky Vendola, leader of the Sinistra e Libert¨¤ (Left and Freedom) breakaway grouping, dreams of new elections altogether.

"There is a time for rebellion of the pure and simple common sense ¡­ People are fed up with Berlusconi for the simple reason that they don't want to sink with him," writes Antonio Padellaro in Il Fatto. There is a moment in which even a country that has seemed lobotomised can react. Berlusconi will resist, holding on to the illusion that all can be fixed, as he always did. He will make promises, threats, he will buy this or that. But he knows it is over.

The next reckoning is in two weeks ¨C on 12 and 13 June ¨C with the referendum on whether to scrap the "legitimate impediment" (which protects Berlusconi from being tried) and on the privatisation of water and on nuclear power, which the government has boycotted and hopes won't get the quorum. But after the huge turnout in these local ballots to crush Berlusconism, the opposition hopes the majority of citizens will hang in there for a last push and let him know loud and clear that he is no longer representing Italy.









European leaders appear to have agreed that Greece can cut its VAT rate in a move designed to win support for more public spending cuts as the embattled nation prepares for a crunch decision on a second international bailout.

Athens was offered the VAT olive branch in a last-ditch effort to win over conservative opposition, which has been demanding tax cuts as the price for agreeing to further EU loans. It believes tax cuts will encourage businesses to expand and help the economy grow.

After several days of wrangling, a German source said the so-called troika team of EU, IMF and European central bank inspectors had struck a deal with the socialist government on VAT cuts as part of a wider agreement that Athens will reduce its debts to below 3% of GDP by 2014. "They have agreed on it," the source said. A deal is expected in the next few days, before an EU finance ministers meeting at the end of June.

However, political agreement remained elusive after the opposition Democracy party warned that it wanted more than a VAT cut. A party official said: "If correct, it is a good step, but not good enough; it is not sufficient to restart the economy."

Greece is expected to miss targets set by the EU last year in exchange for a €110bn (¡ê96bn) bailout. Eurozone governments expect Greece to come up with new measures that will help it cut its deficit at a faster pace. Last year, it posted a deficit of 10.5% and at the current rate the EU estimates it will have a funding shortfall of some 9.5% this year, 2 percentage points above target. By the end of the year its overall debt is likely to reach 150% of GDP. Greece was supposed to raise around €12bn from the debt markets next year to supplement borrowing from the ECB, but with interest rates for 10-year bonds above 16% and estimates that it will need nearer €25bn, that prospect now seems unrealistic.

Analysts said the tax concession revealed a softening of French and German demands for new loans to be tied to deeper spending cuts, with outside officials overseeing accelerated privatisations.

Stock markets were cheered by the news. Commodities climbed as the dollar slumped, with Brent crude up $3 to $117 a barrel. An index of commodities rose 1.2%. The London Stock Exchange was up 51 points at 5989.

German and French officials are keen to strike a deal with Greece, to end speculation that the country will be forced to renege on its debts. German and French banks are some of the biggest lenders to the country. German banks are owed $70bn and French banks $92bn. A restructuring of Greek debt by either lengthening payment times or cutting the amount owed would hurt the balance sheets of these banks, many of which are already in a parlous financial state. Other governments fear a restructuring of Greek debt will lead investors to believe similar remedies will be required in Ireland and Portugal.

The UK is a heavy lender to Ireland with $224bn of outstanding debt, and Spain is a big lender to Portugal, with around a third of Lisbon's debts held in Madrid.

"More aid for Greece does not solve the problem, but it does buy time and limit contagion risk into Ireland, another country with funding requirements in 2012," said Camilla Sutton, chief currency strategist at Scotia Capital, in Toronto.

A report by analysts at Ernst & Young supported fears that Ireland is likely to need extra funds within a few months. It downgraded the country in its latest economic growth forecast after predicting a 2.3% contraction in GDP this year, resulting in the fourth successive year of recession. Ireland is expected to see its overall debts jump above 100% of GDP by the end of the year, putting it third in the EU league of debtor nations behind Greece and Italy.

Richard Batty, of Standard Life Investments, said investors were keen for an early solution to prevent a panic across the eurozone."The danger is that biting the bullet on Greek debt sets in train a domino effect. If you let Greece go to the wall the spotlight will turn on other major debtor nations," he said.

Several economists have called for Greece to restructure its debts rather than pay them back in full through spending cuts and privatisations, which could leave the country with declining GDP and rising unemployment for more than a decade.

The EU has rejected the plan, partly under pressure from the European Central Bank, which also holds billions of euros of bonds issued by Greece and would be a big loser uunder any restructuring plan.

Sepp Blatter insists that despite the serial corruption scandals wrecking his organisation's image, his position at the head of the world game is secure.

Yet never has a Fifa president ¨C the Swiss is due to be elected unopposed for a fourth term on Wednesday ¨C faced such an intense public outcry over the state of the organisation, which has seemed close to implosion as scandal after scandal has come to light.

Blatter, who welcomed Fifa's 208 affiliated associations to the annual congress on Tuesday, plans to press on regardless. "I have been at Fifa for 36 years," he boasted on Monday. He has been president for 13 years and Fifa insiders describe the job as "Blatter's life".

But his proposed new four-year term is unlikely to be without further controversy and many doubt whether he can remain immune to pressures exerted from either inside or outside the Fifa "family". The question is, can any of them dislodge football's great survivor from his place at the top of the world's most popular sport?

Sponsors

The force of football fans' feeling against Blatter has begun to cause disquiet among the multinationals who have attached themselves to the Fifa brand, through its quadrennial World Cup tournament. Adidas and Coca-Cola have both urged change in recent days; now Fifa's financial services and airline "partners" have expressed concern.

"The current situation is clearly not good for the game," said Visa on Tuesday, while Fifa's airline party said: "Emirates, like all football fans around the world, is disappointed with the issues that are currently surrounding the administration of this sport."

Behind the words, there are eye-watering numbers. Fifa has budgeted for almost $300m (¡ê182m) of revenue from marketing in 2012. Adidas alone has paid $325m between 2007 and 2014 to be the official sportswear manufacturer.

Fifa's sponsors are, broadly, US and European concerns for whom corporate image is revenue sensitive, hence their expressions of dismay. Yet whether their unusually tough words will be backed by action is questionable. When pressed, the companies are keen to stress the value of their brand association is with tournaments and players rather than Fifa itself.

Furthermore, the next two World Cups will take place in Brazil and Russia, emerging markets whose richest businesses would relish the opportunity to replace any existing Fifa partners who choose not to renew their associations.

The multinationals would be reluctant to concede such lucrative marketing territory so easily. As Fifa's crisis rumbles on, Blatter knows he still holds some valuable commercial cards.

Red card rating ¨C threat to Blatter's presidency:

Fifa's executive committee

If Fifa's 24-man ruling body (now 22, after the suspensions on Sunday of the vice-president Jack Warner and former presidential challenger Mohamed bin Hammam) had any plans to mobilise against Blatter, its moment passed in a meeting on Monday. In that summit ¨C after which Blatter announced "Crisis? What is a crisis?" ¨C he is believed to have received unanimous support.

Incredibly, only 24 hours after Warner declared that Blatter "must be stopped" while warning of a "football tsunami" about to be unleashed, he called on the Concacaf confederation (covering North and Central America) to support Blatter in election.

But the 75-year-old is not without his adversaries. Korea's Chung Mong-Joon, the vice-president who loses his committee post on Wednesday after what many believe to have been a Blatter-orchestrated coup, remains highly influential in the Asian Football Confederation (AFC).

He is a scion of the family that owns Hyundai, another Fifa sponsor, but has suffered embarrassment with the failure of Korea's 2022 World Cup bid and has become an implacable enemy of Blatter. As the Swiss faces the Fifa congress, Chung would like to embarrass him, so an abstention by the AFC remains a possibility.

National football associations

Although the response to the English Football Association's demand for a postponement of Blatter's coronation was muted ¨C only the Scottish FA has publicly endorsed it ¨C Blatter could still receive a little bloody nose, thanks to the process for which he is such a stickler.

Article 27 of Fifa's statutes stipulates that "elections shall be conducted by secret ballot". Blatter can count on the staunch support of some influential members of the Fifa congress ¨C Brazil, Argentina and Russia as well as most of Europe's footballing powers ¨C but there are many among the 205 federations invested with a vote who are disgruntled with Blatter's stewardship of Fifa.

Some are angry at the damage to football's reputation; others at the way two very senior officials have been suspended over corruption allegations. Under the cover of secrecy, they may have their say; and anything fewer than 160 votes in an uncontested election would be disastrous for Blatter.

Governments

The British sports minister, Hugh Robertson, and his federal Australian counterpart, Mark Arbib, have both called publicly on Fifa to reform. Robertson described the presidential election as "a farce" and "a complete nonsense", while Arbib said countries should no longer spend money bidding to host the World Cup unless Fifa cleaned up its rules governing the process. However, the pressure from politicians around the world has been limited.

Robertson and Arbib both referred to the modernisation of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which followed the 1999 bribes-for-votes scandal over Salt Lake City's Winter Olympics bid. And Jacques Rogge, the IOC president, addressed Fifa's congress on Tuesday, urging Fifa, politely, to do the same, saying: "The IOC emerged a stronger organisation, from within. I am sure Fifa can emerge stronger ¨C and from within."

So far, though, there is no unified pressure from governments of the world for Fifa to reform or for Blatter to make way for a figure of stature who will usher in modernisation.

The media

Britain's media has done much to expose the civil war at Fifa and its corruption scandals, and the storm has had some impact. Blatter has belatedly accepted Fifa has an image problem, which has, in turn, concerned the sponsors. The media has exposed and covered the scandals with growing outrage, beginning in November when two executive committee members, Amos Adamu of Nigeria and Reynald Temarii of Tahiti, were suspended after allegedly asking a Sunday Times undercover reporter for money in return for World Cup votes.

The furthersuspensions of Warner and Bin Hammam at the weekend, followed by Warner's own allegations against Blatter, of which the president was cleared by Fifa's ethics committee, has been a huge story worldwide, although notably more so in the Anglophone press. The French sports newspaper, L'Equipe, and its Italian counterpart, La Gazzetta dello Sport, have relegated the story deep within their inside pages.

The onslaught has shaken Blatter's previously impermeable belief in his own invulnerability, with the president accepting on Monday: "I regret what has happened ¨C great damage to the image of Fifa and a lot of disappointment to football fans."

But his performance before the massed journalists at Fifa's Zurich headquarters also seethed with barely suppressed resentment. He called for "respect," even "elegance" in the journalists' questioning. It will take more than media pressure to unseat this president.

Sepp Blatter should not stand as president of Fifa at Wednesday's meeting in Zurich, let alone be re-elected. But he will stand and be re-elected. Only those blind to the greed and hysteria of world football could regard awarding the 2022 World Cup to Qatar as definitely clean. Blatter knew this, because he was told it over and again. But Fifa is not, as it classes itself, a "world governing body". It is a squalid cartel. The 208 members of Fifa have no interest in rocking Blatter's $1.3bn (untaxed) boat while his rulebook demands a 75% vote to oust him. He can dispense millions to his "electors" and enjoy the security of an autocrat. From his $100m Swiss palace, he calls Fifa "the family within". His nephew, Philippe, controls Fifa's sponsorship and media revenue monopoly.

The UK and its four football associations should have nothing to do with this man, but they are as introverted as he is. When England's FA tried to repair its image by choosing an outsider, Lord Triesman, as its chairman in 2008, he was so shocked that he inadvertently blew the whistle with his allegations. He was vilified by "the family" and forced to resign. The whole business stinks. Even the money stays silent. The four big Fifa sponsors behaved this week like maiden aunts told of a long-secret family scandal: that it was "most distressing".

Last December, David Cameron and Prince William humiliated themselves by going to Zurich to dance attendance on Blatter during the vote on the 2018 venue. Now the FA has returned to the mire by turning up at today's coronation of Blatter's presidency, belatedly trying to give itself some credit last night by calling for the election to be cancelled. International football is run by a self-perpetuating elite, craving the tickets, the lifestyle and, in some alleged cases, the bribes, which have become part and parcel of international sport.

Fifa's senior official under Blatter, J¨¦r?me Valcke, was sacked after being charged by a US court with "repeated dishonesty", and then rehired by Blatter. When he revealed that Qatar's cup bid had in his view been "bought", he protested afterwards that this was not meant as the past tense of "to buy" but rather of "to be efficient". Meanwhile the photographed envelopes containing $40,000 in hundred dollar bills, for each of Fifa's Caribbean voters, were now apparently intended for distribution to the poor. This is ludicrous.

Blatter, who feasts on the adulation of world leaders, has the cheek to warn them to stay out of his business and that of "the family". Only the Swiss authorities might be smirking, with another advertisement for their lax regulation and scope for tax avoidance and corruption that has made them an entrepot for the world's funny money. Blatter may struggle in a reputable corporate climate. As the limousines draw up at Wednesday's meeting, bystanders might wonder if next to arrive is Don Corleone.

Football is no more than a sport and can look to its own. What deserve scrutiny are the murky "international" regulators that huddle mostly in smaller European states and claim sovereignty over everything from sport and culture to science, aid, armaments and world trade. Some bodies hover uncertainly under the United Nations umbrella, performing half-necessary functions such as maritime law or heritage rescue. Others have become puppets of global corporations, such as the World Health Organisation and its 2009 swine flu "pandemic".

Fifa and the International Olympic Committee are stateless cartels, freeloading on the Swiss image of lofty cosmopolitanism. Those who rule these bodies are accountable only to the federations that they themselves run. Juan Antonio Samaranch ran the IOC for 21 years, culminating in a haze of accusations of corruption. Blatter will clock up 16 years following his re-election today. To these men, national governments are dummies run by gullible politicians in thrall to electors so stupid they pay taxes.

In his current BBC TV series, All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace, Adam Curtis ridicules the restless search for world order of various political and intellectual movements over the past half century. Psychological profiling, internet democracy, climatic computer models and Armageddon predictions are all presented as cynical smokescreens for political and financial power.

Common to Curtis's megalomaniacs is that they strive to be above the realm of national democracies. They dust themselves in the global sovereignty that has appealed to visionaries since the Crusades, the League of Nations and the search for a single computerised human intelligence. They claim to have supplanted politics and governments.

Likewise bodies such as Fifa, whose fatuous mission is "to reach out and touch the world". The idea that Fifa should be a "world governing body" of any sort is as outrageous as Bernie Ecclestone being a regulator of motor racing or Don King of boxing. Fifa is an upmarket Sopranos. The key to its wealth, like that of the IOC, lay in appropriating the commercial rights to events it sponsors, pocketing the money and denying it to host nations. As a result, host nations spend vast sums of money stoking up chauvinist hysteria round "winning the games" by way of compensation.

The syndrome was awesomely displayed when Tony Blair and Tessa Jowell went berserk over "winning the Olympics" for London in 2005, never mentioning that the price for two weeks of minor sport would be ¡ê9bn. Despite its avowed internationalism, the IOC requires of its hosts the crude nationalism of lavish opening and closing ceremonies.

Blatter relies on governments lacking the guts to tell their domestic associations to boycott him. No one dares suggest that he be moved to a country where he might be subject to competition law or police investigation. The world of football enjoys a total omerta. Indeed, as revelations of corruption at Fifa began to emerge last year ¨C though rumoured for years ¨C the FA and British government response was to dismiss them and condemn the journalists who reported them.

Nothing will happen. World bodies will remain untrammelled by democratic oversight or legal regulation. There is no evidence that this scandal would have broken surface had Fifa's antics been left to the football authorities or their governments to police. The revelations came from investigations by the UK press, and largely by one journalist, Andrew Jennings, who has hounded Blatter since 2006. It is reasonable to conclude that the only curb on the pomposity and unaccountability of these bodies is not democracy, accountability or the law, but the labours of my own humble profession.

Former French education minister Luc Ferry has told a TV chatshow that a member of a previous French government abused children in Morocco, suggesting that reporting of the affair was stifled by strict libel and privacy laws.

Ferry, a French philosopher who was in government from 2002 to 2004, told the Grand Journal on Canal Plus that senior state sources informed him of a former minister taking part in "an orgy with little boys" in the tourist town of Marrakech.

"All of us here probably all know who I'm talking about," he told the panel of high-flying journalists, alluding to a rumour that has long circulated in media circles. Asked if he had any proof, he said: "Of course not. But I have testimony from cabinet members at the highest level, state authorities at the highest level."

He said the affair was detailed to him at the top of government, "particularly by the prime minister".

Ferry said he would not name the former minister, implying that he feared France's strict libel laws. "If I let his name out now, it's me who will be charged and doubtlessly convicted, even if I know that the story is true."

His remarks come as France's political and media class questions the tradition of respecting private life in the wake of Dominique Strauss-Kahn's indictment for sexually assaulting and attempting to rape a New York hotel maid. Strauss-Kahn denies the charges and is expected to plead not guilty at a court hearing on Monday.

But many journalists have predicted a "before and after Strauss-Kahn" suggesting that sexual harassment in political circles will no longer be tolerated and criminal behaviour should not be hushed up just because it pertains to a politician's private life. France has some of the toughest libel and privacy laws in the world.

This weekend, Georges Tron resigned as civil service minister after two former staff members filed complaints for sexual assault, saying they had been emboldened to come forward after the Strauss-Kahn arrest. Tron denies the allegations. He had hoped to keep his post despite the investigation, but Nicolas Sarkozy feared public opinion. The foreign minister Alain Jupp¨¦, said members of government, even if innocent until proven guilty, must be "above all suspicion".

Women politicians this week began to denounce the sexism that pervades political life. The sports minister, Chantal Jouanno, said she could no longer wear a skirt in parliament for fear of salacious comments

Ratko Mladic was flown to the Netherlands on Tuesday night to face charges at The Hague war crimes tribunal for his role in the killing of thousands of Muslims in the Bosnian war after an emotional final day in Serbia.

The former Bosnian Serb general was flown into Rotterdam airport on a small Serbian government jet and then transferred by helicopter to a 15 sq metre cell in a special unit in Scheveningen prison, a brick castle-like jail in a leafy suburb of The Hague yards from the North Sea coast.

He swept into a side entrance in a police cavalcade under flashing blue lights, avoiding most of the hundreds of onlookers including family members of Mladic's alleged victims and Serbian nationalist supporters of the war crimes suspect. Also looking on were several Dutch army veterans who were part of the UN peacekeeping force which was unable to stop the massacre of 7,500 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995, for which Mladic faces charges of genocide.

"I feel a lot of traumas coming back," said Dijana Zupanovic, 46, a Croatian who said Mladic's forces had killed her 20-year old brother.

"It is unbelievable he is here. It is good to see him in Holland, because I have seen many dead people because of him," said Ren¨¦ Jagt, 37, a private in the Dutch peacekeeping force at Srebrenica.

"For people who have lost their husbands and children, this is a big moment."

"In the detention unit, he will be introduced to the regulations and the rules of the unit and of the tribunal, he will be give a copy of the indictment and then a medical examination," said Nerma Jelacic, the spokeswoman for the International criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia at The Hague.

"He will be held in a isolation cell on his own for at least few days so that his assimilation can be monitored, and after that he will be in a cell in one of the three wings of the detention unit."

After the first few days, Mladic will be able to mix with the prison's other 36 war crimes defendants of various nationalities, including other Serbs, Croats and Bosnian Muslims. They have an exercise yard, computers, televisions, art classes and even massage on request.

The tribunal's prosecutor, Serge Brammertz, will give a statement on Wednesday, and Mladic is expected to appear before judges by Friday to hear his indictment for the worst crimes committed in Europe since the Nazi era.

Before Mladic left Belgrade, he was granted a parting wish ¨C insistently repeated from the time of his arrest ¨C to visit the grave of his daughter, Ana, who killed herself in 1994 with his favourite revolver.

Her motive was reportedly despair at her father's role in the Bosnian slaughter but if she left a note it was never made public. Mladic, who always insisted she had been killed by his enemies, was allowed to linger for 10 minutes, lighting a candle at the black granite grave in a Belgrade cemetery before being driven away in an armoured police motorcade.

The visit angered some of the relatives of the Bosnian dead. Kadira Gabeljic, whose husband and two sons were killed in the Srebrenica slaughter, told the Associated Press: "He was allowed to do it, and I am still searching for my children for the past 16 years, ever since Srebrenica happened.

"My husband had been found, but what about my children? I will wait for years. I might even die before their complete remains are found."

After a 16-year manhunt, Mladic's journey from Balkan fugitive to prisoner in the Netherlands unfolded at remarkable speed.

The 69-year-old former Yugoslav officerwas arrested at his cousin's house in a northern Serbian village on Thursday and faced an extradition hearing the same night. His lawyer, Milos Saljic, insisted he was not well enough physically or mentally to stand trial, and tried to slow the proceedings by sending his appeal by post at the last possible moment on Monday, but Serbia's war crimes court rejected it almost as soon as it arrived on Tuesday.

According to Saljic, the ex-general's wife and sister arrived for a tearful farewell in the early afternoon, bringing a large suitcase of clothes. By the evening, he was on a flight to The Hague.

At his first appearance at the tribunal, Mladic will hear the charges against him, for genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. In particular, he is charged with overseeing the execution of thousands of Muslim men and boys from Srebrenica, whose bodies were found in mass graves after his troops had overrun the eastern Bosnian town. He is also held responsible for the three-year siege of Sarajevo, during which about 10,000 of the Bosnian capital's residents were killed.

Mladic will have 30 days to decide how to plead but there could be many months of preparations before the trial begins.

Ultra-nationalists staged rallies in Belgrade and at Mladic's childhood home in eastern Bosnia but they were easily contained and did nothing to deflect the determination of Serbia's president, Boris Tadic, to deliver Mladic to The Hague and thus remove the most serious obstacle to Serbia's eventual EU membership.

Tadic has also pledged to go after the last Serb war crimes suspect still at large, Goran Hadzic, as well as the suspected network of followers and state officials thought to have sustained and concealed Mladic in his 16 years on the run.

There had been fears that Mladic's arrest might trigger a dangerous backlash among Serb officers with the same Yugoslav army roots, but the demonstrations were thinner and less fiery that those which greeted the arrest of the Bosnian Serb political leader, Radovan Karadzic, three years ago.

The flame of ultra Serb nationalism appears to be guttering, although it could be replaced with a quieter long-lasting resentment. Rasim Ljajic, one of Tadic's ministers, has acknowledged that the government could be voted out at the next elections as a result of Mladic's extradition.







England and Scotland led the way in a brave but unlikely attempt to force reform at Fifa after the Football Association's chairman, David Bernstein, called on Sepp Blatter to postpone Wednesday's uncontested election for his fourth term as Fifa president.

On another day of drama in Zurich, Bernstein issued a public declaration demanding the launch of a "genuinely independent" review of Fifa's governance structures.

Having kept the sports minister, Hugh Robertson, informed of his intentions, Bernstein made a plea for reform that was swiftly reinforced by the Scottish FA's chief executive, Stewart Regan. "This is a matter of principle," said Bernstein on Tuesday. "Myself and the FA believe that the position in Fifa is just not acceptable."

Last night Prince William, who is president of the FA, said he was supportive of the call to postpone the election, Clarence House said. A spokesman said: "The Duke of Cambridge, as president, has been kept informed of the FA's proposals and is fully supportive of the chairman and the initiatives the FA has recommended.

"He considers the transparency of the international governing body to be integral to the good governance of the game."

Despite Blatter's defiance at Monday's press conference, in which he insisted he would only be judged by the "Fifa family", there is believed to be some backing for the measures in certain regions of the world. One influential football figure said the perspective of Bernstein, who has been at the FA for fewer than six months, is potentially refreshing for Fifa, an organisation that is apt to circle its wagons.

With pockets of support in Africa, northern Europe and some other English-speaking nations, Bernstein may have set in train a chain of events that could deliver an embarrassing blow to Blatter's standing among his peers. Whether that will translate into the votes required to change the agenda of the Fifa congress is highly questionable. There will be 205 voting national associations there on Wednesday and, under Fifa statutes, it will require the support of 153 other countries for Bernstein's motion to be carried.

Bernstein himself would not be drawn on what would constitute a moral victory for his campaign. "I am not judging this by mathematics; it is a good result already with the support we have from within the UK," he said. "Sometimes you have to jump without knowing how solid the ground is."

With the Fifa vice-president, Jack Warner, and the former presidential challenger, Mohamed bin Hammam, reacting to their suspensions from all football activity with claims their bans were "politically motivated", there is a risk of revenge against British interests.

Bernstein remains unperturbed, knowing from the humiliation of England's 2018 World Cup bid, which picked up only one non-English vote, that the nation that gave the game to the world is already on the sidelines of international football politics.

"I don't think we will get isolated and nor should we be," he said. "[Fifa] is a democratic organisation and we should be able to express a minority or singular view. I do not believe that because a party takes a stance it should lead to retribution."

More of Fifa's leading sponsors have chosen to make public reservations about the direction the organisation is taking. Visa and Emirates added to the sense of crisis at Fifa with statements on Tuesday.

"The current situation is clearly not good for the game and we ask that Fifa take all necessary steps to resolve the concerns that have been raised," said Visa.

Emirates, Fifa's airline partner, said: "Like all football fans around the world, [Emirates] is disappointed with the issues that are currently surrounding the administration of this sport." Adidas and Coca-Cola had previously announced their displeasure with recent events.

As one local newspaper published the results of a survey indicating that 86% of Blatter's compatriots believe him to be "corrupt" ¨C 7% more assess him as "a bit corrupt" ¨C Switzerland's president, Micheline Calmy-Rey, addressed the opening of the Fifa congress by saying: "Where there are concerns about corruption and transparency, it is necessary to listen and reform your governance."

Jacques Rogge, the International Olympic Committee chairman, was more emollient before Fifa's constituents. He said he was speaking not as the IOC's president but as a "lover of football" and said Fifa could emerge a stronger organisation.

There were echoes of Bernstein's calls from the global anti-corruption body, Transparency International. It demanded the introduction of an empowered, external ombudsman, as well as strengthened auditing measures. "Fifa delegates know that they must clean house if their vote is to have legitimacy," said Transparency International's Sylvia Schenk.

However, Bernstein faced strong opposition from one of football's grandees. The 95-year-old Jo?o Havelange spent 24 years as Fifa president and was Blatter's mentor. He told Brazilian journalists: "Do you think they would do the same if there was an Englishman running alone for the presidency?"Late last night there was fresh evidence of further meltdown within Fifa as Concacaf's acting president, Lisle Austin, first attempted to sack the whistleblower and Warner's chief accuser, Chuck Blazer, only for the confederation to issue a statement an hour later saying he had no authority to do so.

Silent whistleblower

Amid a febrile atmosphere at the Fifa congress in Zurich, with claims of corruption flying back and forth, the world's media appeared to be the victim of a hoax when up to a hundred journalists rushed to a press conference called by a mystery "whistleblower", only to find the venue empty.

On Sunday, news organisations had been alerted to the event, at a hotel on the outskirts of the Swiss city. There was promise of revelations of bribes linked to the award of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, and of a "mystery guest" in the form of a senior Fifa official prepared to tell all.

When the press arrived, however, no whistleblower could be found. "There had been a press conference booked in," confirmed Vanessa Flack, manager of the Dolder Grand hotel, "but it was cancelled this morning."

Suspicion initially fell ¨C unfairly, of course ¨C on the Union of Zurich Taxi Drivers, who benefited from the non event to the tune of CH60 (¡ê43) for each journalist cab fare.









At 9.20pm the calm of a spectacular sunset over the North Sea in the well-to-do Dutch resort of Scheveningen was shattered by a police helicopter, as it swooped over the town jail and hovered over the dunes.

Its arrival, when the local burghers are normally finishing their seaside strolls, presaged the arrival in custody after a 16-year-manhunt of Ratko Mladic, the fomer Bosnian Serb general charged with some of the worst crimes committed since the second world war.

Within minutes, a cavalcade of black 4x4s had swept along the sea road and into the side entrance of the prison, whose 18ft walls bristled with barbed wire and CCTV cameras. Mladic's arrival meant different things to different people, and besides the international news crews hundreds of people had come to witness the most wanted suspected Balkan war criminal finally enter international custody.

"It feels really unnatural," said Dijana Zupanovic, 46, a Croatian woman clutching a camera, who said Mladic was responsible for killing her 20-year old brother while he was ill in hospital.

"It shouldn't be happening here. He should be judged in his own country."

Just yards from her was a small knot of pro-Mladic supporters: one with a Serbian flag, another with a silver crucifix around his neck, wearing a T-shirt bearing Mladic's face.

"I feel a lot of trauma coming back," said Zupanovic. She gestured towards the pro-Mladic men.

"I can see the Mladic supporters here and it takes me back."

It was also a moment for the Dutch, a nation racked by the inability of their soldiers, serving as United Nations peacekeepers, to prevent the massacre of around 7,500 Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica.

Ren¨¦ Jagt, 37, a former private in the Dutch army who was at Srebrenica and had travelled from Lelystad, an hour away, to witness Mladic's arrival, fiddled nervously with his camera as the crowd waited for Mladic to finally enter custody. Jagt was wearing a sweatshirt with the blue beret of the UN peacekeeping force on it and the slogan: "Peacekeeping is not a soldier's job, but only a soldier can do it".

"I was in Bosnia for six months and 17 days," he explained after Mladic had arrived and his worried look had turned almost into a smile. "I was there for peacekeeping. My job was to protect the Muslims there. This feels good. A lot of my colleagues were damaged by Srebrenica, what they saw and what they could not do."

Monique de Vette, 49, a finance director from The Hague, and Edwin Santhegens, 52, a landscape architect, had swapped their usual evening beach walk to watch Mladic be brought in, aware that it was a potential moment of healing for their country.

"I feel like justice is done, not just for the Muslims, but for the Dutch soldiers who were powerless. Many of them are still suffering," said De Vette.

"It is just a coincidence the tribunal is here in The Hague, but it is a good feeling for us," said Santhegens.

"Mladic is responsible for murdering thousands of people just 2,000 kilometres from here. We were stupid to take a role there. We didn't understand the strength of the Serbian armed forces. If there is some justice done here in the Netherlands it will help us and it will help the whole of Europe."

An hour or so after Mladic had entered the jail and the onlookers had drifted home, the unmarked police cars that brought him in left the compound, each passenger wearing a balaclava to disguise his or her identity. As they swung out of the prison grounds the knot of Serbian nationalists screamed abuse at them. On Wednesday, the war crimes prosecutor will set out details of Mladic's case to the world's media and Mladic himself could make his first appearance in court as early as Thursday.










The actor Steve Martin has found himself caught up in the biggest art forgery scandal in German history after it emerged he bought a painting "by" German-Dutch modernist Heinrich Campendonk, which turned out to be a fake.

Martin purchased the piece, Landscape With Horses, in 2004 from a Parisian gallery. He has since resold it and told the New York Times earlier this week that he is not yet certain if he is liable to compensate the buyer.

"The gallery that sold me the picture has promised to be responsible to me, if I'm responsible, but it's still unclear," Martin, who is not accused of any wrongdoing, told the Arts Beat art blog. "It wasn't clear that it was a fake until after Christie's had sold the picture ¨C it was a long time after that, that it became known." The actor, a long-term art aficionado who has referenced his passion in films such as LA Story, added that the forgers "were quite clever in that they gave it a long provenance and they faked labels, and it came out of a collection that mingled legitimate pictures with faked pictures".

Martin's purchase ¨C he paid $850,000 and sold the painting for a loss at $500,000 to a Swiss businesswoman in 2006 ¨C is just one of many believed to have been faked by a German forgery gang arrested by police last year. Alleged mastermind Wolfgang Beltracchi, his wife Helene, her sister Jeanette and accomplice Otto Schulte-Kellinghaus are accused of selling 44 of the paintings over the past decade. They include fakes of early 20th-century works by Campendonk, Max Pechstein, Max Ernst and several others.

The paintings are said to have been excellent forgeries, fooling a number of experts in the art field. The forgery gang invented backstories for most of them, suggesting they were part of two collections saved during the Nazi years: one from Helene and Jeanette's grandfather, Werner Jagers, the other from Schulte-Kellinghaus's grandfather, a tailor named Knops. Several of the paintings ended up in French galleries, including Cazeau-B¨¦raudi¨¨re, where Martin made his purchase. An expert had supposedly confirmed the piece's authenticity prior to the actor handing over his money.









Yes, this lady is for turning! For spinning, indeed. Last autumn, Angela Merkel's mistake-prone coalition government decided that Germany's nuclear power stations should continue to operate until 2035, which overrode a decision to quit nuclear energy by 2022 made by the government of Social Democrats and Greens in 2001. Seven months, a nuclear catastrophe in Japan and several regional losses by Merkel's Christian Democrats later, she's changed her mind again. On Monday night a historic decision was made, the government declared: Germany will be the first industrial country in the world that renounces nuclear power for good.

All power plants will by switched off by 2022. Sounds familiar? Germany is not only quitting nuclear power, but it's quitting for the second time. This shows you how much we Germans fear radiation. It's a fear that has become deeply embedded in the psyche of the country. Since Fukushima, one can see on walls, doors, backpacks, bikes and everywhere else the logo of the anti-nuclear movement from the 1970s. A smiling sun saying "Atomkraft? Nein danke" has returned. People have put up the logo on their Facebook profiles, thousands have marched on the streets and the Greens, who grew out of the original anti-nuclear movement, have become stronger than ever. They could even provide the next chancellor. Suddenly everybody is against nuclear power, and Merkel is leading the movement. She's no Iron Lady, but rather a chameleon. No wonder the Greens are angry she stole their clothes.

The decision to quit nuclear energy is politically correct, but is it economically sustainable and environmentally brave? Nobody is celebrating yet, because many questions remain.

Eight power plants were switched off immediately after Fukushima ¨C without causing problems. (It makes you wonder why they were built in the first place.) Those old ones won't come back. The remaining nine plants can still go another 10 years on full power, until 2021. The last one, the newest, has to be switched off by the end of 2022. For many critics this is still much too long, too many years with possible dangers, terrorist attacks for example, ahead.

Will Germany face blackouts because of the closures? The earlier compromise of 2001 provided a less radical, gradual switch-off over several years. How to avoid such problems, especially in the winter time, is one of the open questions. One solution being debated is to keep one nuclear power station on stand-by. But the technology is so complicated, and you can't just switch a nuclear power plant on and off like a TV set. It would cost ¡è50m per year to operate.

In order to bridge the gap, the government will support the building of new fossil-fuel plants, mainly gas and coal. It seems that Germans prefer honest, pure coal smoke than clean but invisible and eternally poisonous radiation. That emissions may go up seems a lesser concern. Let's just plant a few more trees and support fair-trade coffee growers in Brazil.

The hope is also that eventually the gap may be filled by wind energy or other eco-friendly energy sources. The government is set to spend more in order to raise the proportion of ?kostrom (green energy) by 2020 to 35%. It would be a massive incentive for the German wind and solar power industries.

That is a very ambitious project: at the moment Germany has 17%, already one of the highest percentages in Europe. It's not clear if it's feasible to increase further, because already there are B¨¹rgerinitiativen, or "not in my backyard" groups, protesting against anything that is more intrusive than a candle: coal energy plants, windparks or overhead electricity cables.











The former Bosnian Serb general Ratko Mladic will be arraigned on 11 charges including genocide and crimes against humanity on Friday morning, judges at the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia have announced.

The former commander of the Bosnian Serb army faces accusations that forces under his command massacred over 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in July 1995.

The indictment also alleges his troops tortured, mistreated and physically, psychologically and sexually abused civilians confined in 58 detention facilities in 22 municipalities. Mladic is also facing charges for the shelling and sniping of Sarajevo, during which thousands of civilians were killed and wounded.

The announcement of his arraignment came after Mladic spent his first night in the United Nations detention unit in a seaside suburb of the Dutch capital. He was flown from Serbia on Tuesday afternoon and was taken under police escort into a isolation cell at dusk where he underwent a medical examination.

Mladic, 69, will be asked to enter pleas on all charges relating to his alleged masterminding of atrocities throughout the 1992 ¨C 1995 Bosnian war.

The tribunal has appointed Judge Bakone Justice Moloto of South Africa, Judge Christoph Fl¨¹gge from Germany and Judge Alphons Orie from the Netherlands to preside over the trial.

If Mladic complies with the schedule, his arraignment on Friday could bring him into the same court building as his superior during the Bosnian war, Radovan Karadzic. The former Bosnian Serb president is currently on trial for similar charges.

On Wednesday, Karadzic was in court dressed in a smart black suit and crisp white shirt and followed his case closely on two computer monitors. He looked relaxed, yawned and itched his nose.

His trial has already been under way for 18 months and observers at the court point out they are not even halfway through the evidence.

Before he left Serbia, Mladic's lawyer, Milos Saljic, insisted he was not well enough physically or mentally to stand trial. He tried to slow the proceedings by sending his appeal by post at the last possible moment on Monday, but Serbia's war crimes court rejected it almost as soon as it arrived on Tuesday.










The number of people reported sick in Germany from a food-borne bacterial outbreak that has already killed 16 spiked over the last 24 hours, with nearly 100 more people suffering from severe and potentially fatal symptoms, according to the national disease control centre.

The agriculture minister, Ilse Aigner, said scientists were trying to find the source of the unusual strain of the E coli bacteria, which are believed to have been spread within Europe on tainted vegetables ¨C and to discover where, in the chain from farm to grocery store, the contamination occurred.

"Hundreds of tests have been done and the responsible agencies ... have determined that most of the patients who have been sickened ate cucumbers, tomatoes and leaf lettuce, and primarily in northern Germany," Aigner said on ARD television.

"The states that have conducted the tests must now follow back the delivery path to see how the cucumbers or tomatoes or lettuce got here."

German officials initially pointed to a few cucumbers from Spain, but further tests showed that those vegetables, while contaminated, did not cause the outbreak. Officials are still warning all Germans to avoid eating raw cucumbers, tomatoes or lettuce.

E coli is found in large quantities in the digestive systems of humans, cows and other mammals. It has been responsible for a large number of food contamination outbreaks in a wide variety of countries. In most cases, it causes non-lethal stomach ailments.

But enterohemorrhagic E coli(EHEC), causes more severe symptoms, ranging from bloody diarrhoea to the rare haemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS).

Germany's national health agency, the Robert Koch Institute, said 470 people are now suffering from the syndrome, in which E coli infection attacks the kidneys, sometimes causing seizures, strokes and comas. That figure is up from 373 reported Tuesday. Germany typically sees a maximum of 50 to 60 HUS cases in a year.

The World Health Organisation said cases of EHEC had been reported in nine European countries: Austria, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the UK. ARobert Tauxe, a food-borne disease expert at the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said it was extraordinary to see so many cases of the kidney complication from a food-borne illness. "There has not been such an outbreak before that we know of in the history of public health."

He added that the strain of E coli in the European outbreak had not been seen in the US, where there have been several high-profile foodborne outbreaks in recent years, but none with such a high death toll.

Neither is there much precedent in Europe: in 1996, an E coli outbreak in the UK caused 216 cases and 11 deaths.

The WHO said 86% of those sick in the current outbreak were adults, two-thirds of whom were women. It said it was unusual that relatively few children were affected.








What have dodgy cucumbers with added E coli got to do with the Greek debt crisis? Not much, unless you notice a tendency among irate Germans to lash out and blame their fellow Europeans when something bad happens.

There's a lot of it about in these difficult times. Just look at this morning's wonky manufacturing figures.

As the Guardian reports, German ministers backed down on Tuesday. "Spanish cucumbers are not the cause," the federal agriculture minister conceded. Too late, alas, to prevent severe damage to Spain's food exports, its farm business and its already-battered labour force (unemployment is 21% and rising).

This is another example of the risk that offset the benefits of having a highly integrated European market as part of an increasingly globalised economy. Wednesday's Guardian reported on British firms leading the pack ¨C at last, we're No 1! ¨C in buying up African acreage for biofuel development.

Felicity Lawrence's agri report from Guatemala, whose history is more cruel than even Spain's, is another part of the bigger picture in which there are winners ¨C such as British supermarket shoppers (so far) ¨C and losers, although low wages should always be benchmarked against even lower ones, which may previously have existed locally.

Let's stick to Europe for now. The Tunisian crisis has triggered a Mediterranean immigration panic (who predicted that?) which has seen Italy and France bickering. The Schengen Agreement on the free movement of EU citizens (Britain did not sign, but messed up in its own way) is also under pressure.

In distant Scandinavia, notably within Finland's populist True Finn party but also in Denmark (I read that it takes its name from a Viking prince called Dan) and Sweden, xenophobic politics are resurfacing. France has the National Front, and even the gentle Netherlands is affected.

Thank goodness Germany's inoculation against such tendencies still works 65 years after starting the course of treatment. But there are signs of frailty, as the burdens of being the EU's paymaster seem to outweigh the huge benefits that accrue to the thriving German economy.

Cucumbers apart, the debt crisis is far from over. The IMF, which is a bit rudderless since Dominique Strauss-Kahn resigned as managing director, is insisting the eurozone agrees to new loans to the waterlogged Greek economy in 2012.

If not, the IMF won't risk its shareholders' money paying out the next tranche of the old loan, due on 29 June.

The EU will probably blink between now and the next summit at the end of this month. But Chancellor Merkel's leadership is timid, and her coalition shaky. What else can explain Germany's fatuous decision to close down all its nuclear plants by 2022, as if buying French, and even Polish, nuclear power to fill gaps will make it either more virtuous or safer?

So things could go wrong. That's what happens when systems are under stress, and mere mortals make mistakes. Balkan expert Misha Glenny penned a terrific piece in the FT this week which recalls how proud, imperial Europe collectively killed itself a century ago by error and miscalculation, not design.

In the process, he argued how splendid it would be if the EU demonstrated enough statecraft to allow West Balkan states ¨C not just Croatia and post-Mladic Serbia but minnows such as Bosnia, Kosovo and Macedonia ¨C to join the EU in time to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the June 1914 shot at Sarajevo. This incident lit the Balkan "powder keg" and started the first world war.

It is unlikely to happen. Creditor north European countries, and not just Germany, are feeling wary of debtors from the south and do not want to rush to embrace more. If anything, some would like to expel Greece from the eurozone. This is possibly the best answer for Greece, since it could devalue the revived drachma and have a hope of recovery ¨C not currently evident.

But it would hugely destabilise the euro at great cost, even in the short term. The evidence so far is that EU strategists will do anything to prevent this if they can. Greek voters may have to accept a loss of economic sovereignty to Brussels and Frankfurt (if not Berlin directly) and German voters' greater costs.

Neither will enjoy it, and the EU moved to appease Greek feelings on Tuesday. But the presence of shaky economies inside the eurozone does bestow one benefit on German exports, which its citizens would be wise to remember. The euro may be high against sterling, still quite high against the (deliberately?) low US dollar ¨C $1.42 against $1.60 at its peak ¨C although not against the rock-solid Swiss franc. But in a German-dominated core eurozone, it would be much higher.

Lots of good things are still going on in Europe due to the machinery of co-operation and integration painstakingly built up over many decades (even the courts are right sometimes), and it's usually best to look on the brighter side. If you want a spot of gloom, try reading Larry Elliott's Guardian column.

With rising oil and commodity prices, an unbalanced UK economy and global warming, it's a miracle any of us can get out of bed in the morning. But most of us do.

It's helpful to be realistic, which is something politicians get scolded for when they try. Vince Cable did recently in the Guardian, and Alistair Darling famously did when referring to the "worst crisis in 60 years" in August 2008.

Balancing realism with long-term optimism is a very hard formulation. Churchill did it in his "blood, toil, tears and sweat" speech of May 1940, when we were in REAL trouble.

Subsequent prime ministers routinely try to pull off the trick again ¨C "short-term pain for long-term gain" ¨C just as David Cameron is doing now. In our pampered world, where we fall out over cucumbers, how well would we respond if our backs were seriously against a tottering wall.

Better than we tell each other, I like to think. But you do wonder.







The Football Association would favour a complete ban on English supporters at overseas matches if that were the price of keeping an English team in international soccer following the violence at Saturday's World Cup game in Switzerland.

The FA is considering abandoning its England Travel Club, an organisation set up three years ago to limit the distribution of tickets to fans with identity cards who had agreed to abide by a code of conduct.

It has not succeeded in controlling the violence, particularly where tickets are freely on sale at the ground, as they were in Basle.

Five England fans are still in gaol in Basle being questioned about the looting of a jewellery shop. Another 27 were detained before the match by Swiss police and put onto trains returning to Britain. Swiss police said 12 people were "significantly injured" and one man was stabbed.

"Personally I don't care if we have no more support away from home," Mr Ted Croker, secretary of the FA said yesterday. "We may well have to ask football's governing bodies to put pressure on countries we visit, perhaps even order them not to sell tickets to English supporters."

The Swiss police and football authorities seemed unprepared for the notorious English supporters, even though their behaviour at Turin last summer received wide publicity and a fine of ¡ê8,000 imposed by UEFA, the European soccer organisation.

Alcohol and tickets were freely available at the Basle ground on Saturday, even though the FA had asked for both to be strictly controlled. Only 40 Swiss police were on duty to keep order among 40,000 fans.

It was the first time the Swiss police had had to use tear gas aerosol sprays or dogs at a football game.

Mr Gwilym Robert, Labour MP for Cannock, said people convicted of violence abroad should have their passports confiscated, but officials pointed out that temporary passports could be obtained easily at any Post Office.

Football violence is no longer a purely British vice, but is becoming increasingly common in Holland and Germany too. Most European police forces have learned how to control it. The notorious French CRS riot squads had few problems with Liverpool's supporters in Paris at the European Cup last week.

But the combination of banning the sale of alcohol, controlling ticket sales and making travel to away games inconvenient and expensive has failed to staunch football violence in Britain.









Prosecutor Serge Brammertz says former Bosnian Serb military commander Ratko Mladic will be formally charged with genocide at the UN war crimes tribunal at The Hague on Friday Link to this video
Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb general facing trial for genocide and ethnic cleansing during the war in Bosnia, is being "very co-operative" with the international war crimes tribunal and requires no urgent medical attention, court officials have said.

A doctor and nurse examined Mladic, 69, at a jail near the Hague after his extradition from Serbia on Tuesday night and decided he needed no immediate care beyond the standard medical examination for inmates, according to John Hocking, registrar of the UN international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

The absence of any pressing medical issues will boost hopes among the families of victims of the Srebrenica massacre and other atrocities with which Mladic is charged that the former commander of the Bosnian Serb army will stand trial rather than claim he is too ill.

Before Mladic left Serbia, his lawyer, Milos Saljic, had insisted he was not well enough physically or mentally to face the court. Mladic also told a Serbian court he did not recognise the authority of the Hague tribunal.

Hocking stressed that Mladic would have access to specialist medical care in prison if he needed it.

"We had no problem understanding each other and he was clearly paying attention and listening to the information that we were providing him with," said Hocking who met Mladic as he arrived from Belgrade. "He asked instructive questions and understood the material being presented."

Mladic is due to be arraigned on 11 charges including genocide and crimes against humanity on Friday at 10am.

He will be asked to enter his pleas in front of judges Bakone Justice Moloto of South Africa, Christoph Fl¨¹gge from Germany and Alphons Orie from the Netherlands, who have been selected to preside over the trial.

Mladic is yet to appoint a defence lawyer and will spend the coming days meeting court officials and deciding how he wants to proceed, Hocking said.

Mladic has 30 days to appoint a permanent defence lawyer. Mladic arrived at the jail wearing a suit and met its commanding officer and was briefed on his rights to phone calls, visits and consular assistance, as well as available education programmes, including language courses, the registrar said.

Serge Brammertz, the tribunal's prosecutor, said Mladic's arrest "confirmed that no one can count on impunity against war crimes".

He added: "His crimes left communities broken and a nation torn apart. We know an important responsibility lies in our hands. Ratko Mladic will receive a fair trial and his rights will be respected."

Brammertz admitted frustration that Serbian authorities had taken so long to arrest a man he described as the most senior military general being held to account for atrocities in Bosnia.

"Sixteen years is a long time to wait for justice," he said. "We understand the victims have been impatient and we recognise their courage ... He could have been arrested 16 years ago and that would have been the only good solution. So this is taking place very late, but not too late.

"We have said many times we want Serbia to prosecute those who have been involved in the criminal networks.

"We want to verify who over the past five years have been instrumental in helping Mladic to stay in hiding and we want them to be accountable."

Brammertz said he now was "cautiously optimistic" about the prospects for the arrest of the last remaining major fugitive, Goran Hadzic, 52, an ethnic Serb general charged by the Hague tribunal with 14 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

"The full significance of Ratko Mladic's transfer to the Hague is difficult to express," said Brammertz. "The process of establishing his accountability has only just begun."

Mladic faces accusations that forces under his command massacred more than 7,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in July 1995.

The indictment also alleges his forces tortured, mistreated and physically, psychologically and sexually abused civilians confined in 58 detention facilities in 22 municipalities.

Mladic is also facing charges for the shelling and sniping of Sarajevo, during which thousands of civilians were killed and wounded.

The prosecutor conceded it was possible the trial involves so much evidence that even though much of it has already been heard in the ongoing trial of the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, hearings could continue beyond the date in 2014 when the tribunal on the former Yugoslavia is due to draw to close.

The trial of Karadzic, Mladic's master, on the same charges and in the same courtroom where the former general is due to appear on Friday has already taken 18 months and the prosecution have only got through an estimated third of its case.

"Our challenge is to present a manageable case that accurately reflects the crimes," said Brammertz.

He said it was "theoretically possible" that Mladic and Karadzic could be tried in the court together, but indicated it was unlikely, and he did not rule out breaking the charges into separate trials.

Brammertz declined to comment on the suitability of the appointed judges. Orie was removed from presiding over the trial of Karadzic in 2008 after the Bosnian Serb president had alleged he could be biased as the Dutchman may have a personal interest in the case of the Srebrenica massacre.

Dutch soldiers were acting as UN peacekeepers in what was supposed to be a safe haven when the killings took place.

In an interview with Der Spiegel in July 2009 Fl¨¹gge questioned whether it was appropriate to define the Srebrenica massacre as a "genocide" reflecting an ongoing debate among international lawyers.

He was subsequently removed from the trial chamber in the Karadzic case.








As Barack Obama heaped praise on the Irish nation time and time again in his keynote speech at Dublin's College Green, a collective quip started up amid the gathered southern Irish journalists.

While the taoiseach looked on as the president seduced his adoring audience, reporters, broadcasters and commentators whispered to each other: "Enda [Kenny] should call the election now!"

It is less than three months since the people of the Republic went to the polls and put Kenny's Fine Gael and the Irish Labour party into power with one of the largest majorities in history.

An outsider might think it would be the height of madness to declare another election now but, given the feelgood factor swirling around the south at present, maybe it wouldn't be such a loopy idea after all.

Working and living in Dublin, and with the "outsider eye" of someone originally from Northern Ireland, it has been astonishing to witness the major events of the last month in the Republic.

Over those momentous seven days in May, the country has welcomed a Queen and a president, bade farewell to one of its most respected prime ministers ever and, in between, captured European rugby's most prestigious prize.

Walking about central Dublin after Obama and his entourage left early to escape that Icelandic ash cloud, listening to the giddy reaction of the public to that speech, conversing with barmen who had been to Cardiff last week to see Leinster's Heineken Cup triumph, you wondered whether there was still a recession gripping the nation.

One of the Irish government's main hopes from the two visits is that they will give tourism a major boost. Last year, one million fewer tourists visited Ireland than in the previous year ¨C the vast bulk of the stayaway holiday-makers being from the UK and the US.

The global pictures of the Queen and Prince Phillip disarming and charming the Irish public and the "money shot in Moneygall" of a US president downing a pint of Guinness will be used to persuade British and American travellers to come to the Republic in greater numbers.

In terms of British tourism, the overpowering message from the Queen's successful tour was that Anglophobia, if not fully dead in the Republic, is now confined to a tiny minority of recalcitrant republicans.

Their inability to mount any serious protests or bring large numbers out onto the streets during the royal couple's four-day visit is evidence of that. The genuinely warm reception the Queen received in Dublin's National Convention Centre or on the streets and in the markets of Cork City will in turn bolster the goodwill most British people feel towards the Irish and Ireland.

Throughout that week, both during the Queen's tour and the 24-hour whirlwind visit of the Obamas, Failte Ireland were never far away, hosting a series of lavish parties for the world's media, putting on a superb buffet (with the same menu the Queen was enjoying) and handing out freebie goodies including free Irish food recipes.

The Republic's national promotion bodies, like tourism and food, certainly do a good sell, and their efforts will be compounded by the positive stories emanating from Ireland after months and months of appallingly negative publicity.

More foreign visitors will follow, but the central question remains: will that be enough to lift the country out of the economic and fiscal mire it fell into after the Celtic Tiger boom went bust?

Just a few hours after Air Force One left Dublin and crossed the Irish Sea, there was a fascinating debate on RTE's Frontline programme, hosted by the excellent and erudite Irish broadcaster Pat Kenny.

The first half of the show looked towards the near future and what the Republic's options are to restore its national finances and try to pay back the multi-billion bailout loan to the global financial institutions.

One of the most interesting contributions came from a woman from the Economist Intelligence Unit, which carries out worldwide surveys of economies across the planet. Amid the euphoria of the royal and presidential visits, she reminded the panel and the audience that there still lurks the tip of an iceberg with the world "default" written on it.

Her point was that the huge debts Ireland already has run up (in part caused by the disgraceful, avaricious behaviour of the banks, including two that operate in Northern Ireland) are not sustainable. The country cannot afford to pay back the billions of euros it had to borrow from the IMF and the European central bank to keep public services running and pump cash into the toxic banking system.

In the end, she contended, the Irish government will have to default by any other name by 2013 rather than continue to force more financial pain on its citizens and further depress the economy. This has, in recent days, been dismissed by Kenny's minister of finance, Michael Noonan, although another minister in the government did speak out of turn last week and indicate that a bail was possibly on the cards.

At this point, it seems everyone loves the Irish ... at least in the Anglophone world, and especially in London and Washington.

Among the modern Republic's traditional friends in Paris or Berlin, however, there may be less goodwill. If the Economist Intelligence Unit assessment is correct and the Republic does default, the French ¨C and especially the Germans ¨C will be looking for some payback, possibly in the guise of Ireland's low corporation tax. No kind words from David Cameron, William Hague or Obama are likely to persuade the big EU players not to ask Ireland to pay some price for default.

Kenny had a good day out with the Obamas, and gave a rousing (if somewhat elongated) warm-up speech to the main act at College Green.

He knows there are darker days ahead, even if more American tour buses pull up at Moneygall's main street looking for Ollie Hayes' pub or more British holidaymakers take a trip to the Garden of Remembrance, avoiding the heroin addicts who use it as a shooting gallery, to see where the Queen made Anglo-Irish history last month.

There will be more cuts in the public sector, and more spats with his European partners in the months and years ahead.

In the meantime, the best he can do to sustain the current popularity of his coalition is to ensure that some of those who created the fiscal mire end up on trial. A few top bankers in handcuffs would be a sight that might bring more than 25,000 out onto Irish streets to celebrate.










Marie Antoinette's infamous response to the news of bread riots prior to the French Revolution, "Let them eat cake", may be apocryphal but it contains an essential truth about the unwillingness of the powerful to accept responsibility for a crisis. Neither is there any attempt to offer a solution that might involve some change to the privileges of the mighty.

Europe has seen the sharpest contraction in output since the end of the second world war. This is accounted for by an investment strike by the private sector. In the EU the fall in gross fixed capital formation (investment) was €565bn of a total loss in output of €611bn.

Yet everywhere the cry has gone up that Europe is uncompetitive and that there is only one solution to this new-found cause of the crisis: cutting wages. Employers' organisations are having their own Marie Antoinette moment and ignoring their own refusal to invest. Instead, they argue, wages must be cut and pension entitlements axed, while corporate taxes must be lowered.

Belying any notion of "austerity", which implies all sectors of society must reduce their standards of living in a common cause, the lrish employers' organisation Ibec is pressing for lower wages among some of the lowest-paid workers in sectors such as fast food and hospitality. It is attempting to override the decisions of the joint labour committees and, emboldened by the favourable response it is getting from the new Fine Gael/Labour coalition government, Ibec is now also arguing for the abolition of the JLCs altogether.

These proposals follow the policies of both the current and previous Dublin governments in implementing cuts in the pay of public sector workers and imposing a pensions levy, in effect a tax increase. The economic illiteracy of the latest proposals is highlighted in a statement by 36 economists, economic analysts and social scientists under the umbrella of the Tasc thinktank. As one of the signatories, I am happy to support a statement that highlights the damaging effects of cutting pay for the lowest-paid workers.

The previous government commissioned a report into the effects of the JLC wage-setting arrangements, which found that they in no way harmed employment and further recommended that the committees be supplemented by collective-bargaining arrangements and that employment conditions be standardised.

If the new Dublin government ignores the evidence of an independent commission it will be clear that its policy is not based on restoring prosperity or even the alleged loss of competitiveness. Instead it will be an attempt to restore productivity and profits by driving down wages and employment. This is all justified by talk that the economy is "broke", yet the net income of the corporate sector was €38.8bn in 2009 , even while the investment strike continues.

As a part of the old English ascendancy in Ireland, George Osborne has long been an admirer of the free-market economic mismanagement of successive Dublin governments. One of the first acts of the new Tory-led government in Westminster was a cut in public-sector pay and jobs. There will also be a pensions levy.

This will have little impact on the deficit, as lower incomes means lower income taxes, lower VAT returns and increased welfare payment for the working poor and unemployed. As mortgage defaults rise it will also further damage the banking sector. But lower deficits are not the real target ¨C higher profits are.

Instead of taking money from the poorest in society, European governments could take money from the richest who refuse to invest and are sitting on cash mountains. Governments could invest on their own account, in transport, infrastructure, education and housing, which would actually restore prosperity and lower the deficit.










The mysterious German E coli outbreak that has killed 16 people shows no sight of abating, with 365 new cases confirmed on Wednesday.

The source of the outbreak remains unknown, though the majority of those affected either live in Germany ¨C particularly in or around the northern city of Hamburg ¨C or have travelled there recently.

The German disease control agency, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI), reported 365 new E coli cases today, a quarter of them involving the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS), a serious complication resulting from E coli infection that affects the blood and kidneys.

European Union officials said three cases had also been reported in the US, adding that most infections reported outside Germany involved German nationals or people who had recently travelled to the country. On Tuesday, a Swedish woman became the first person to die outside Germany after returning from a trip there.

On Wednesday, the northern state of Mecklenburg Western Pomerania issued a plea for blood donations in case the number of victims continues to rise.

German authorities initially identified cucumbers imported from Spain as the likely source of the outbreak but they admitted on Tuesday that further tests on the cucumbers showedthat, while contaminated, they did not carry the bacterium strain responsible for the deaths. They have still not identified the cause, but raw lettuce, tomatoes and cucumbers remain prime suspects, with authorities recommending that consumers in northern Germany avoid all three.

Spain said it was considering legal action after the false alarm.

"We do not rule out taking action against authorities which have cast doubt on the quality of our produce, so action may be taken against the authorities, in this case, of Hamburg," the deputy prime minister, Alfredo P¨¦rez Rubalcaba, told Cadena Ser radio.

Spanish farmers say lost sales resulting from the crisis are costing them €200m (¡ê176m) a week, and could cost 70,000 jobs in a country that already has the EU's highest unemployment rate.

Several European countrieshave reportedly blocked entry of Spanish cucumbers, but EU health commissioner John Dalli said the commission had received no official confirmation of any import bans.

Russia's consumer protection watchdog repeated a threat to outlaw all vegetable imports from the EU, having already banned raw vegetable imports from Germany and Spain.

"Despite repeated requests, Russia's consumer protection watchdog has not received information from the European Union about the source of the infection, about dangerous produce or about measures being taken to localise and combat the outbreak," it said in a statement on Tuesday.

French government spokesman Fran?ois Baroin said the country had taken the precaution of setting up a crisis unit to deal with a possible outbreak in the country, with health officials across France on alert for signs of new cases.









Appearance: Suit, glasses, science beard.

Oh good. Wisdom isn't wisdom unless it's bearded. Quite. And guess what? There's now an ash tsar.

Tobacco, volcanoes or late-period Britpop? The second one. Iceland's got plenty more, apparently, so the government has appointed someone to take charge of things.

Splendid. Who? Professor Sir John Beddington, the government's chief scientific adviser.

And the professor will stop them all erupting, will he? Unlikely. But when they do erupt, he'll ensure that Britain gets into a more orderly tizz.

How? He'll "head a peer-review group that will analyse sources of data on ash concentrations", according to the BBC.

He's going to read some books about volcanoes, isn't he? Yes. With tea and peers. And he may adjust the computer models a bit. Beddington is a fellow of the Royal Society, remember. He specialises in "the application of biological and economic analysis to problems of natural resource management".

I see. Where to park on a Monday, who gets the last muffin . . . That sort of thing? No.

There seem to be a lot of tsars these days. There do. A Commons report last year found that the Labour government appointed 40 of them.

Cripes! I know. It's lucky that dauntless scourge of bureaucracy, the Conservative party, is now in charge. By my count, its coalition has appointed only Mary Portas (high streets), Lord Wei (big society), Mike Bracken (internet things), Lord Young (enterprise) and Beddington so far. Although Lords Young and Wei later chucked it in, the latter because he couldn't squeeze all that tsarring into his spare time.

How ironic. Very ironic.

So now that Beddington is sorting out the ash, does that mean no more TV appearances from Ryanair's larger-than-life chief executive Michael O'Leary? Alas, no. Not even a tsar is powerful enough to ensure that.

Do say: "A tsar is born."

Don't say: "It's tsar-studded government."







An accusation of child abuse against a former French minister has sparked a major row in the wake of the charges against Dominique Strauss-Kahn for attempted rape.

Luc Ferry, a philosopher and former education minister, told a TV chat show that a former French minister had previously been caught at an orgy with young boys in Marrakech in Morocco. He said senior government sources, including a former prime minister, had told him about the incident, but would not name the ex-minister involved for fear of libel laws.

Politicians attacked Ferry for making vague allegations. Rachida Dati, the former justice minister, said if Ferry knew something he must reveal the facts otherwise he risked the offence of failing to report a crime. The foreign minister, Alain Jupp¨¦, said if Ferry ¨C who was in government from 2002 to 2004 ¨C had proof of a crime "he must go through the justice system" and not just "go yacking to the press".

A Moroccan NGO for the protection of children said it would file a legal complaint, demanding an investigation. Under French law, authorities are able to investigate sex tourism or sex crimes committed abroad.

Meanwhile, the philosopher and writer Jean-Fran?ois Kahn, who was on the talk-show panel with Ferry, told the webiste Arret Sur Images that after the programme, Ferry had given him the name of the former minister, though Kahn refused to reveal it.

On Wednesday, Ferry repeated his claims on TV, but said he had no proof or facts.

Strauss-Kahn, the former head of the IMF and one-time Socialist hopeful for next year's presidency, has denied allegations that he attempted to rape a New York hotel maid. He is expected to plead not guilty on Monday.

The case has sparked a wider debate in France on whether the media should do more to investigate politicians' private lives.

Sepp Blatter rode a crashing wave of anti-English sentiment within the "football family" to extend his presidency of Fifa for another four years.

Corruption scandals have caused alarm among sponsors, national governments and fans alike, but amid an atmosphere of bridling indignation, world football's governing body threw up the barricades in Zurich. Blatter loyalists mounted attacks on English press, parliamentarians and football politicians before celebrating his new mandate with a standing ovation.

In his acceptance speech, after Blatter had won 186 out of 203 votes in the ballot of Fifa's member associations, he thanked delegates for "your vote and your confidence" and pledged curtly to "put Fifa's ship back on the right course in clear, transparent waters".

An hour later, Blatter revealed that former US secretary of state Henry Kissinger would head the "politicians, celebrities and former footballers" making up the "solution committee" that would address the corruption problems that have shredded Fifa's reputation. Kissinger is a long-term associate of Blatter.

The vote in the uncontested election had taken place only after an attempt by the English Football Association to force a postponement suffered a heavy defeat, by 172 votes to 17. The FA chairman, David Bernstein, said he was exercising his democratic right to propose a measure without which Blatter could not have a "proper, credible mandate".

The FA initiative drew ferocious criticism from Fifa's second-most senior politician, Julio Grondona of Argentina. "We always have attacks from England, mostly with lies and with the support of a journalism which is more busy lying than telling the truth," he said.

Grondona confirmed his message that he would only support England's 2018 World Cup bid if the Falkland Islands were "given back" to Argentina because they "belong to us". He insinuated that Bernstein's measure had been motivated by bitterness at England 2018's failure. "It looks like this country doesn't like it and doesn't show goodwill. Would you please leave the Fifa family alone?"

Moucharafou Anjorin, federation president of Benin, the world's 72nd-ranked team, took the podium to say: "I'm ill at ease that this comes from a country like England with its football standing.

"Some people in Africa take great pleasure from watching English football on the television. This is why I do not understand why we want to create more tensions within Fifa. England should not be conveying this message. England should not divide us."

Joining Anjorin was the Congolese Selemani Omari ¨C his country 122nd in Fifa's rankings ¨C who delivered impassioned rhetoric with a veiled message to the English dissenters and media. "Fifa belongs to 208 associations, not one or another," he said. "We're ill at ease with people who wield unfounded accusations. He who accuses must provide evidence.

"We have no lessons to take. If there is a single candidate also sometimes it is because we are satisfied with the candidate."

In an attack on the English media that he did not seek to conceal, Costakis Koutsokoumnis from Cyprus (89th) said: "Allegations. What a beautiful English word. We must not allow people outside this room to enter Fifa's agenda."

There had been only one name on the ballot papers after the Qatari challenger, Mohamed Bin Hammam, after withdrew in an effort to clear his name amid allegations of vote buying. Bin Hammam and the Fifa vice-president, Jack Warner, have been suspended from the federation. On the platform Warner and Bin Hammam's seats, as well as those of two other members of the ruling executive committee serving similar bans, remained vacant throughout the proceedings.

Although football's political structures showed faith in the man at the helm, there are questions whether the storm has yet abated.

Theo Zwanziger, the chairman of Germany's federation, called for an inquiry into the process that led to Qatar winning the right to host the 2022 World Cup.

Zwanziger's words carry the force of a serving Fifa executive committee member after he joined it upon the retirement yesterday of Franz Beckenbauer. However, there were messages of defiance from other of football's senior politicians who bristled at the allegations swirling around Fifa.

"It is enough," said Angel Maria Villar Llona, a former Spanish international who heads Fifa's legal committee. "Let us not be led by these people. They are assaulting us with crimes we've not committed. They assault our freedom."

Before the vote, Blatter spoke of being the "captain of the Fifa ship". He only had to make modest concessions: future World Cups will be selected by the whole Congress instead of the 24-strong executive committee; an internal committee will examine Fifa's corporate governance; and the ethics committee will be strengthened, once again an internal process.

But his message of triumph was more one of congratulation for delegates' defensiveness. "I am happy we are able again today to bring this solidarity and unity which allows us sufficient courage and also a positive standpoint," Blatter said. "Something marvellous has happened today in this solidarity."








Not since the B movie Attack of the Killer Tomatoes have our salad bowls looked so threatening. In Germany, vegetables carrying E coli have caused the death of 16 people, while more than 100 are suffering from serious, potentially fatal, symptoms.

The Food Standards Agency insists there is no evidence that any contaminated vegetables have reached the UK (although the exact source of the outbreak has not yet been determined). Nevertheless, the footage of destroyed Spanish cucumbers ¨C originally thought to be the problem ¨C was enough to make most people cast a worried eye in the direction of their fridge.

This isn't the first time danger has lurked close to our lettuce. In 2007, an outbreak of salmonella in the UK was traced to imported basil, while an E coli outbreak in the US in 2006 was caused by pre-packed spinach. And in 2008, 145 people in the US were made ill by eating tomatoes infected with a rare strain of salmonella.

In her book Not on the Label, Guardian journalist Felicity Lawrence says that between 1992 and 2000, when bagged salads took off, nearly 6% of food-poisoning outbreaks were associated with prepared vegetables and salads. In 1996 a study of retail samples of bagged salad found 13% contained E coli.

So should we forgo our five-a-day for the sake of our health? Sadly for vegetable-hating children, the answer is no. The Health Protection Agency says that while small, localised outbreaks of E coli have been linked to fruits and vegetables, they are very rare.

Gad Frankel, professor of molecular pathogenesis at Imperial College London, says: "I don't think salads are particularly dangerous. The rate of infection is very low, so when it happens it really makes the news because it's so rare." Any increase in incidents, he says, may be due to the fact we now eat more salad as we seek to make our diets healthier.

Mark Wilcox, professor of medical microbiology at the University of Leeds, agrees, saying that while salads have more potential for passing on deadly organisms because they are uncooked, "they are not a high risk or you would hear about it all the time."

Bagged salad, he says, which is often washed in spring water or chlorine, is less likely to be infected than a whole lettuce where the heart is harder to clean. E Coli is found on the surface of vegetables, adds Wilcox, because it is a faecal organism so gets on to them from the soil, water or people's hands ¨C and other infections can also be caused in this way. "Bean sprouts are occasionally contaminated with salmonella ¨C again from faecal matter. Listeria is an organism that can be soil-borne and get on to vegetables too and the other one I always remember is toxaplasma ¨C excreted by kittens."

Stephen Vaughan, whose company All Food Hygiene has run food hygiene courses in the UK for 20 years, is less optimistic. "In the last decade there has been a rise in low-dosage organisms such as E coli, campylobacter and listeria. With salmonella, you need to eat millions of the bacteria to get ill, but with campylobacter you need only 500. Campylobacter is the number one cause of food poisoning in the UK.

"We have to be much more careful because we are importing so much more salad and vegetables from abroad. In the UK we have got rid of sewage in our rivers and our water is cleaner."

While the experts say there is no need to worry, the FSA is advising people to wash vegetables that cannot be peeled or cooked. But is a quick splash enough? "The more you wash and soak, the greater the effect," says Wilcox. "When I was a kid, my gran would always soak the salad in salty water as it is somewhat antibacterial."

Vaughan is more cautious. "The most sensible way to wash vegetables at home is to use Milton Sterilising Fluid. You need to use a double sink method ¨C one bowl with Milton diluted in water (as per the instructions), then put your fruit and vegetables in there for 20 minutes. Fill the other sink with tap water to wash off the chlorine. It leaves no taste and kills the bacteria."

If all this is putting you off, Frankel says, comfortingly: "I will still have a salad today, and so will my children."

At last they've got him. There's not much good news from Europe at the moment, but the fact that Ratko Mladic is now sitting in the detention cell of an international tribunal in the Hague is a cause for unqualified celebration. The man directly responsible for the massacre of 8,000 unarmed men and boys at Srebrenica will now be held to account for that and other atrocities. This is another step forward in one of the great developments of our time: the global movement towards accountability.

Just over 60 years ago, the Polish poet Czes?aw Mi?osz wrote a poem addressed to the torturers and mass murderers of one of the bloodiest periods in European history. "You who harmed an ordinary person," he warned, "¡­ do not feel safe." People may heap sycophantic praise on you now, but "the poet remembers", poeta pamieta.

Back then, that was about all your mass murderer had to be frightened of: the poet remembering. A post-1945 moment of very imperfect international accountability, symbolised by the Nuremberg trials of Nazi leaders and the founding treaties of international humanitarian law, had faded behind the iron curtains and instrumental amnesias of the cold war. Even the most basic facts about many atrocities were systematically concealed or falsified. Monsters died in their beds, with their medals still hanging from the uniform in the wardrobe. Only the poet remembered; the poet, and the ordinary person, if still alive.

But those post-1945 ideals never quite died. From the 1970s onward, many different forms of accountability were developed, from Latin America to South Africa and from south-east Asia to south-east Europe: truth commissions, judicial investigations, the opening of archives, banning compromised people from holding public office ("lustration"), domestic and international trials. All have their place, but an international court is the best way yet discovered to deal with the vilest of the vile: those credibly accused of crimes against humanity.

In national courts, there are generally legal contortions and the strong suspicion of a partisan political agenda. Is an Egyptian court fining former president Hosni Mubarak $34m for having shut down the internet really the right way to address his political responsibility for the previous regime? The Egyptian military obviously thinks so ¨C but then, this deflects attention from its own culpable role under Mubarak.

International courts, such as the special tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, which holds Mladic, and the International Criminal Court (ICC), are also open to multiple objections. Apart from the slowness of the judicial process, which resulted in former Serbian leader Slobodan Milo?evic dying still unconvicted in the Hague, most of these objections come down to the charge of double standards.

Why, cry many Serbs, do you arraign only Serbs, not Croats and Bosniaks? That accusation is simply false. Beside charging Milo?evic, Mladic and Radovan Karad?ic, the tribunal has convicted the Croat general Ante Gotovina and is currently re-trying Ramush Haradinaj, a Kosovar Albanian guerilla leader.

Why, say others, do you fry the big fish and let the little ones swim free? That is true, but inevitable. You cannot try all the tens of thousands responsible, in different degrees, for the horrors of any dictatorship. Would it be better the other way round: catch the small, let the big go free? That was the more damning charge against de-Nazification in the late 1940s.

Then there's the objection, "why do you prosecute X but not Y?". Why Milo?evic and the Liberian Charles Taylor, but not Than Shwe of Burma or Bashar al-Assad of Syria? To this there are several answers. One is: if you can't catch all murderers that doesn't mean you shouldn't catch any. Another is: maybe the ICC should be prosecuting Y too. And a third: differential responses don't always mean double standards.

If a leader oversteps the very extreme mark that qualifies you for a charge of crimes against humanity, then he or she should everywhere and always be liable to prosecution in an international court. If, however, their past misdeeds fall short of that very demanding standard, there is room for local understandings. If the leader has consented to a peaceful negotiation from dictatorship, that good conduct should be taken into consideration. For example, it is quite wrong that the Polish martial law leader Wojciech Jaruzelski, who was not guilty of crimes against humanity and tried to make amends by helping Poland's transition to democracy in 1989, should still ¨C as a very old man ¨C be on trial for those earlier misdeeds.

The most difficult choice would come if a leader such as Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, who has terrorised his people and certainly merits prosecution, were then to play a Jaruzelski-type part in a negotiated transition. But there is no sign of that. Is anyone seriously going to argue that the only thing holding Gaddafi back from statesmanlike abdication is his recent arrest warrant from the ICC?

In the rest of the world, the charge of double standards is mainly directed against the west, and especially against the US. From Latin American dictators to the current rulers of Saudi Arabia ¨C so runs a popular indictment ¨C Washington's tyrannical friends have got away with murder while its foes are liable to be assassinated. Over the past 60 years, there have been too many individual instances of such extreme "realist" double standards. However, the killing of Osama bin Laden does not belong on that list.

Yes, in some ideal world, Bin Laden would now be sitting in a cell in the Hague, down the corridor from Mladic, Gotovina, Gaddafi and many more. But does anyone seriously believe the Pakistani security services could have been relied on to deliver Bin Laden to an international court? Tell that to the brave Pakistani journalist who has just paid with his life for reporting the entanglement of those very security services with al-Qaida. In an extremely dangerous nighttime operation, in hostile territory, with no idea what Bin Laden had under his belt, you could not expect a US Navy Seal to stop and read that ruthless mass murderer his rights under UN conventions. But that was, and should remain, a very exceptional case.

In general, if international law is to have any chance of deterring the monsters of tomorrow, then we need the US to support it practically and not just rhetorically. That means applying international law to itself, not just to others. At the moment, the US is not even a member of the ICC.

I have talked of a "movement towards accountability", but there is nothing irreversible about that movement. As the affairs of the world are increasingly driven by non-western powers that pique themselves on the defence of their own sovereignty, the trend is quite likely to be reversed. If the profoundly satisfying thing that happened this week to Ratko Mladic is to have any chance of becoming an international norm, rather than a transient European exception, the US must throw its weight behind the kinds of institution that will make this possible. To celebrate the arrest of Mladic, the US should join the International Criminal Court.









Danish navy commandos have ended the occupation of an Arctic drilling rig by Greenpeace by breaking into the protesters' survival pod hanging off the drilling platform.

The navy unit broke into the pod just before midnight, four days after the two activists began their occupation of the drilling platform of Leiv Eiriksson, an oil exploration vessel operated by the British firm Cairn Energy.

The arrests of Luke Jones, from Leeds, and Hannah McHardy, from the US, end a 10-day long action by Greenpeace and its protest ship Esperanza against Cairn's drilling operations off Greenland. The activists are now being held and are likely to be deported.

Last year, four Greenpeace protesters occupied another Cairn rig in the same area for about 30 hours after attaching a climbing platform under the structure. That protest was brought to an end by severe weather.

Ben Ayliffe, a Greenpeace International campaigner on board the Esperanza, said: "Our team stopped this rig from drilling for four days, which was four days in which a Deepwater Horizon-style blowout couldn't happen and this beautiful fragile environment was safe.

"Our climbers are in jail now, but this won't stop us opposing the madness of drilling for oil in a region where a spill would be almost impossible to clean up. This isn't over. We'll keep on pushing till the oil companies get out of the Arctic."

Cairn denies that its drilling operation was affected by the occupation. It and Greenland's government insist that its oil spill emergency plan is detailed and comprehensive, and argue that oil wells have been sited in the Arctic for several decades.

Ireland may not be able to return to the international debt markets until 2018, a senior British banker has predicted.

Harvinder Sian, chief euro area interest rate strategist at the Royal Bank of Scotland, told an audience of Irish lawyers and bankers that if the Irish government were to tough it out without a default or a top-up to the current bailout, its return to the markets could be delayed for "another five years from 2013".

This is because it would take that long to get a clean bill of health free of any unsustainable debt and other risks.

However, a senior banker from Deutsche Bank says he thought investor confidence could be restored far more quickly and good behaviour coupled with austerity might prove attractive to a certain class of fund looking for high returns.

Sian told an audience of 100 Irish business people gathered at Deutsche Bank in London that in the long run, sticking rigidly to the "no default, no new bailout" programme could be a far more painful option than joining an expected restructuring programme in the second half of 2013 when Greece is expected to default. July 2013 is the key date for bailout countries because this is when the new expanded EU bailout fund comes into being. Unlike the present fund, it will lend on the basis that there is burden-sharing by the private sector.

Sian said if Ireland went this route it would have to look "fantastic" on economic fundamentals for the markets to allow Ireland to borrow at any reasonable interest rate. This is where the extra five years of measures (from 2013) to bring debt down to acceptable levels comes from - because Ireland will be issuing de facto junior debt at this point.

Is it not easier to default and get it over with?

Sian said it was important for Ireland to continue to redouble efforts to bring down bank debt, but ultimately it might have to accept the lesser of two evils.

"If Greece and Ireland and Portugal are priced to restructure, is it not easier for Ireland then to draw a line and say, rather than go through effectively being controlled by Berlin and Brussels for the next two electoral cycles perhaps, is it easier just to take a haircut and then return to the bond markets? That would be the far less painful option," he said.

The markets want the current crisis to "morph" into some sort of "cohesive fiscal policy" in the eurozone, said Sian, and if that happens then the Greek deal will create an acceptable default "template" for Ireland and Portugal.

"The next question for the market will always be who's next. And putting aside Ireland for a minute ¨C Portugal will be next [to default]. Unlike Ireland it doesn't have a growth trajectory, it needs a huge amount of reform, the kind of stuff that went through in the 80s in Ireland. And that takes years and years to come back from, so the possible credibility there is quite limited. So we see Portugal being priced to restructure at some point.

This opens up two possibilities for Ireland in 2013, he said - write off some of the debt or go solo and continue for another five years with austerity.

"Ireland sticks to its guns - and I think the point about the willingness to go through with the austerity measures is very, very important - if the debt GDP ratio is coming down, the government may decide, or, the electorate may decide, more importantly, that they can get through it and it may take another five years from 2013 to get back to the debt markets. I think it will take that long."

His remarks come just days after Ireland's prime minister Enda Kenny insisted the country would not be defaulting on any of its debt or seeking a second bailout in the event that it would not be able to return to the market.

He said the IMF programme to reduce Ireland's debt won't ever satisfy the markets, even if Ireland achieves every single target in the four-year programme including a "reasonable" growth in GDP of 4%.

"The problem is this adjustment [to get debt and deficits down] is likely to take several years and the market just doesn't have the appetite to wait that long."

He said Ireland had a lot of positives - it was definitely not like Greece, which he described as "a corruption story" where "governance is more akin to something you would find in Africa than in western Europe".

But he believes Ireland's future will nonetheless be bound up with Greece and Portugal.

"What we've had over the last six months is a putting up of the barricades around Europe to limit the fiscal contagion on to countries such as Germany, Netherlands, Austria and Finland.

"This, we believe is the beginning of a more systemic crisis in the eurozone, it is not really an Ireland-specific story, but where it will lead, we believe, is to a continued discussion about haircuts with regards to Greece.

Greece will provide template for Ireland

"There will be nothing involuntary before [July 2013] - this is what Angela Merkel has told us and we take her word on it. After that, we think the politics dictates that Greece will have to take a haircut and that template would be seen by investors as a signal for political cohesion but also a template for Portugal and Ireland.

So ultimately we've had a very negative view on just where the Irish debt markets will be and much of the reasoning behind that is actually external to Ireland. "

Ireland will be attractive to investors soon, says Deutsche

Conor Hennebry, director of capital markets and treasury solutions at Deutsche Bank, who also spoke at the event, is less pessimistic about Ireland's chances of returning to the markets.

He said Ireland's good behaviour in relation to austerity was attractive.

"Now is quite a good time to be an improving but still risky story. Investors are very keen on yield, they are very keen on finding places they can earn more than the tiny amount they can get from the world's central banks from overnight money."

Hennebry said as long as Ireland showed willingness to get its house in order, there wasn't another banking catastrophe and the Blackrock stress tests weren't proven to be wrong this time next year, Ireland would be in a good position to borrow again.

But he warned that Ireland would "need to be very rigorous, not just as a government, but as a society if it is to access the bond markets again".

The one glimmer of hope that "may do the trick" of expediting growth, Sian believes, is a recovery in property prices ¨C but that is a "very long bet".

"For us, that [property recovery] is a 2014/15 story, so too far forward really to have a meaningful impact," he says.

Three Chechen men have been convicted in Austria for their role in an exile's death during a botched kidnapping that authorities allege was ordered by Chechnya's president, Ramzan Kadyrov.

Umar Israilov, 27, was shot dead outside his Vienna flat in January 2009. The suspected gunman has fled the country, prosecutors have said.

Austrian investigators have said they believed ¨C mostly based on circumstantial evidence ¨C that Kadyrov ordered a kidnapping of Israilov that went fatally awry.

Kadyrov's spokesman, Alvi Karimov, has denied the president's involvement in the murder, which followed Israilov's attempt to bring the Kremlin-backed leader before the European court of human rights on torture charges.

The Vienna court on Wednesday handed three men sentences of life, 19 years and 16 years, the Austria Press Agency reported.

Prosecutors had demanded life sentences for Chechnya-born Otto Kaltenbrunner, Suleiman Dadayev and Turpal Ali Yesherkayev on charges of abetting murder, acting as a foreign agent and conspiracy. The defendants' lawyers had called for acquittals.

The three men were also ordered to pay damages of €25,000 (¡ê22,000) to Israilov's family.

The court's attempts to get Kadyrov to testify via video link came to nothing.

"It is up to you whether you will allow political murders to take place in Austria," the prosecutor Leopold Bien told the jury.

Amnesty International's Heinz Patzelt welcomed the verdict and appealed to Russia to follow up on the case, noting the court had made clear "the people in the background are to be sought abroad and that this is a political contract murder."

Chechnya remains volatile a decade after Moscow drove separatists out of power in the second of two wars. The Kremlin credits Kadyrov ¨C who fought against Russia in the first war but then switched sides ¨C with maintaining security in the region.

But rights activists say that in return for relative stability the Kremlin turns a blind eye to Kadyrov's heavy-handed rule and torture at home and abroad, accusations he has denied.

Dubai police have accused an adviser to Kadyrov, Adam Delimkhanov, of masterminding the March 2009 killing of a Chechen, Sulim Yamadayev, in the emirate, which he denied.

Yamadayev's brother Isa has accused Kadyrov of the killing, as well as of orchestrating the 2008 murder of his other brother Ruslan, though Isa has since made peace with Kadyrov.







A new and more virulent strain of the E coli bacterium caused the outbreak that has killed 17 people and left more than 1,500 ill across Europe, the World Health Organisation has announced.

Hilde Kruse, a food safety expert at the WHO, told the Associated Press it was "a unique strain that has never been isolated from patients before ... [its characteristics] make it more virulent and toxin-producing".

According to the Health Protection Agency three British nationals have been infected as well as four Germans in the UK. All are believed to have caught it in Germany. Three are believed to have developed haemolytic uraemic syndrome, a rare and severe kidney complication that destroys red blood cells and can affect the central nervous system.

The HPA has said it is working with the Food Standards Agency and there is no evidence of suspect produce being distributed in the UK.

As the number of cases continues to rise , Russia has extended its ban on imports of raw vegetables from the European Union ¨C a move condemned by Brussels as "disproportionate" ¨C and Spain is threatening legal action over the initial attempt by Germany to blame the outbreak on imported Spanish organic cucumbers.

Russia initially banned imports of raw vegetables from Germany and Spain but is extending the ban to all EU countries. Gennady Onishchenko, head of the Russian consumer protection agency Rospotrebnadzor, told the Interfax news agency the deaths "demonstrate that the much-praised European sanitary legislation which Russia is being urged to adopt does not work".

"How many more lives of European citizens does it take for European officials to tackle this problem?" he told the RIA Novosti news agency.

Exports of all vegetables, including raw vegetables, from the EU to Russia were valued at €594m euros last year, with France, Germany and Poland the biggest exporters.

European Commission spokesman Frederic Vincent said health commissioner John Dalli would be writing to Moscow "within hours" warning the ban was disproportionate.

Spain is seeking compensation from Germany of its farmers, claiming lost sales are costing €200m a week and could put 70,000 people out of work.

In Germany a health official admitted the precise source of the disease may never be traced. Reinhard Burger, head of the Robert Koch Institute, told the BBC: "I think the number of cases will come down, but how long it takes I'm not sure. It could be indeed weeks or months and I'm not sure if we will really find the source." The RKI reported 365 new cases on Wednesday and said a quarter involved a life-threatening complication.

At the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, Denis Coulombier, head of surveillance and response, said there was a strong link between the disease and consuming fresh vegetables.

"To have such a high number of severe cases means that probably there was a huge contamination at some junction," he told Reuters. "That could have been anywhere from the farm to the fork ¨C in transport, packaging, cleaning, at wholesalers or retailers ¨C anywhere along that food chain."

In Britain the HPA is urging travellers to Germany to avoid eating raw tomatoes, cucumbers or leafy salad, especially in the north of the country, and anyone returning with symptoms including bloody diarrhoea is being told to seek urgent medical attention.

Dr Dilys Morgan, head of the HPA gastrointestinal department, said: "The HPA continues to actively monitor the situation very carefully and we are working with the authorities in Germany and with our counterparts across Europe as to the cause of the outbreak. We have alerted health professionals to the situation and advised them to urgently investigate and report suspected cases with a travel history to Germany."

Professor Hugh Pennington, a microbiologist from the University of Aberdeeen, told the BBC that the oubreak was unusual because it didn't seem to be affecting young children. "Children under five have had a very hard time with this kind of bug in the past. They seem to be escaping it ¨C maybe just due to the nature of the food that's causing the problem."










Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb army commander, will face genocide charges in The Hague. Photograph: AP
Boris Tadic, Serbia's reform-minded president, was understandably cheerful when I met him last week. As my plane landed in Belgrade, the world learned that Ratko Mladic had just been arrested. Europe's most wanted fugitive was behind bars and now faces trial in The Hague for crimes against humanity. Tadic told me that, by capturing Mladic, he had moved his country closer to playing its full part in today's Europe. I agree.

The capture matters for two big reasons. First, it reminds mass murderers everywhere that the world will not countenance their crimes. A further step has been taken towards a world in which justice trumps tyranny.

Second, it adds to the real hope for lasting peace in the Balkans. We are approaching the centenary of the gunshot in Sarajevo that triggered the first world war. Ever since then (and, indeed, for years before), "Balkans" has been a byword for division, conflict and brutality. There is no certainty that those days are over, but there is now a space for politics and dialogue to replace the bloodshed.

In the hours following Mladic's capture, the media made much of the fact that it took place on the day I was due to meet Tadic. Having been briefed on the details of the capture, I am certain the timing was pure coincidence. However, what is not a coincidence is the link between Tadic's wish to take Serbia into the European Union and his insistence on removing the stain of how Serbia's rulers behaved in the 90s. He is determined to catch the tide of democracy that has replaced communist, nationalist and fascist tyrannies throughout the rest of Europe.

My job is to help him do that ¨C and to help others with the same ambition. With Croatia (we hope) completing negotiations this year, and Serbia, perhaps, starting them next year ¨C possibly alongside Montenegro ¨C momentum is growing. Eight years ago at Thessaloniki, the EU agreed to admit all the countries of the region into the union as they meet its standards.

We never expected the process to be quick or easy. The wounds of history take time to heal. There is much unfinished business throughout the region. But the hope of joining the EU, and sharing in its ideals and prosperity, has provided a powerful incentive to settle old differences. Last September there was the risk of a divisive UN resolution on Serbia's continuing dispute with Kosovo. I invited Tadic to Brussels to discuss this privately. He returned home accepting amendments that the whole general assembly could agree. My team now facilitates talks between Serbia and Kosovo on practical day-to-day issues.

Earlier this month, I persuaded Milorad Dodik, the leader of Bosnia's Serbs, to withdraw his threat of a referendum that could have provoked new conflict. I am now seeking to lower tension in Albania.

In all these cases, we are building on the lessons of the past two decades. We intervened too late in Bosnia and Herzegovina but when we did, eventually, military commanders such as Rupert Smith and diplomats such as Richard Holbrooke used the power of the international community to end the fighting. Afterwards, Europeans such as Javier Solana, Carl Bildt, Paddy Ashdown and Bernard Kouchner gradually ensured that jaw-jaw replaced war-war.

Much remains to be done. We do not ¨C and should not ¨C grant EU membership lightly. We demand full democracy, an open economy, the impartial administration of justice and an end to corruption. Our pressure, and practical help, are already making a difference. But the pressure that matters most comes from within, from people who want to change their country and their lives. The end of the story is not just membership of the EU but also much better access to international investment and opportunities for business and growth ¨C all badly needed in the region.

The evil that men do gets lots of column inches. The good is often buried, or not mentioned at all. Few are aware of all that Ivo Josipovic and Jadranka Kosor, Croatia's president and prime minister, have done to transform their country, nor of how they and Tadic have been tackling the legacy of Serbo-Croat conflict. I look to Tadic to show the same boldness and generosity in dealing with the even more complicated issue of Kosovo. I know he has willing partners in Pristina.

We should not be starry eyed about the region. Differences remain. Politics could fail. Violence could return. But nor should we retreat into hand-wringing pessimism. Virtually everyone I have spoken to on my visits wants the EU to play a more active role. I tell them we are happy to do that. But I also tell them there is something we cannot do. Leadership ¨C a vision of the future and a readiness to take risks for it ¨C is the mystery ingredient that foreigners cannot supply.

Aristotle said the state is a moral entity. Its transformation needs moral leadership. There is real hope that, with EU membership the prize, this kind of leadership is beginning to spread across the Balkans. Our challenge, and it is a tough one, is to help it last.









The wife of the Northern Ireland first minister, Peter Robinson, has been cleared of wrongdoing over the awarding of a council business deal to her former teenage lover.

The review followed revelations that Iris Robinson had arranged ¡ê50,000 in secret loans for 19-year-old Kirk McCambley so he could open a cafe on the banks of the River Lagan in Belfast. The cafe was leased from Castlereagh borough council where she was a Democratic Unionist party representative.

Robinson's political career ended after the scandal broke last year. She left the council, gave up her seat in the Northern Ireland Assembly and stood down as MP for Strangford.

But on Thursday evening councillors given a private briefing on the review said it cleared the council and its representatives, including Robinson, of wrongdoing.

The DUP leader on the council, Jimmy Spratt, said: "This report brings this chapter in the history of Castlereagh Borough Council to a close."

He added: "There is no evidence of wrongdoing by officers of the council or either past or current councillors."

The disgraced former "First Lady" of Ulster politics left public life last year and moved to London for several months where she received counselling.

She returned to the public sphere last week when she accompanied her husband, the leader of the DUP, at the dinner hosted for the Queen in Dublin by the Irish president, Mary McAleese.

Spratt said: "Over the last 14 months, Iris, Peter and their family have been in our thoughts and prayers and we were delighted that Iris felt able to attend the banquet to mark Her Majesty the Queen's visit to the Irish Republic last week.

"We send her continued best wishes for a full recovery."

It was fitting that Serbia's president, Boris Tadi?, himself announced the arrest of Ratko Mladi? in Belgrade. Nobody has put in a greater effort to run down the indicted war crimes suspect than Tadi?. For years, foreign governments and, above all, the chief prosecutor of the Hague tribunal, have accused him of not having done enough to find the former Bosnian Serb general. They implied that Tadi? was frightened that a nationalist backlash in the event of Mladi? being arrested might even lead to the toppling of his government.

His own prime minister Vojislav Kostunica ¨C until he left office in 2008 ¨C systematically dragged his feet during the hunt for Mladi?, and some diplomats suspected he hindered the investigation. Tadi?, by contrast, placed the capture of Mladi? at the top of his political agenda from the moment he was elected president in 2004. He knew full well that until that happened, Serbia's aspiration to join the EU would be blocked.

In his previous incarnation as minister of defence, Tadi? had undertaken a root-and-branch reform of the Serbian military, which included breaking up the military intelligence operatives suspected of forming the backbone of Mladi?'s supporters when he went into hiding. Tadi? also oversaw the reform of Serbia's domestic intelligence service, bringing in younger agents who were less susceptible to the old yet hugely powerful secret police network built up under communism before the break-up of Yugoslavia.

While in public, western governments have criticised Tadi? for not doing enough on Mladi?, and maintained debilitating sanctions at the request of the Hague tribunal, behind the scenes Tadi? permitted an unprecedented level of co-operation between his security forces and western intelligence agents. Their number one goal was to find and extradite Mladi?.

Like his friend, and sometime mentor, Zoran Djindjic ¨C the reforming Serbian prime minister assassinated by dissident nationalist paramilitaries in 2003 ¨C Tadi?'s greatest asset has been his determination to face down conservative and nationalist forces who threaten disruption. The president had witnessed how the earlier arrests and extradition to the Hague of the toppled Serbian dictator, Slobodan Milosevic, and the Bosnian Serb military leader, Radovan Karadzic, had not triggered a nationalist revolt. Serbs merely shrugged their shoulders.

It was often argued that Mladi? was different and that, as a military man, he would act as a more powerful magnet to the malcontents in Serbia ready to exploit the widespread disaffection resulting from the current economic crisis. That is almost certainly not going to happen. It is undoubtedly true that many Serbs are still convinced that the west has singled out Serbia for special punishment in the wake of the conflict of the 1990s. But they are not going to sacrifice the benefits that they will accrue from EU membership out of spite. Most Serbs inside Serbia are no longer interested in the fate of Mladi?; possibly they never were. The pull of the EU long ago trumped the mystique surrounding the wartime leader.

Furthermore, enough has now been published and broadcast in Serbia for people to realise that Mladi? was not the knight in shining armour many once thought he was. The first chink had appeared a year before the notorious massacre at Srebrenica, when his daughter, Ana ¨C seemingly distraught at her father's growing reputation as a mass murderer ¨C committed suicide in Belgrade.

It is again thanks to Tadi? that the revelations about Mladi?'s psychopathic tendencies have been properly aired in Serbia. He has taken the lead in denouncing the bloody crimes committed by the Bosnian Serb forces as well as atrocities such as the mass killing at Ovcara in Croatia and the siege of Vukovar. He has bowed down and sought forgiveness for these events on behalf of Serbia.

These courageous acts have received little media attention outside the former Yugoslavia. But the arrest of Mladi? is the final proof that Tadi? is a man of deeds as well as words.

Most of the obstacles blocking Serbia's path to EU membership will now be lifted. But this does not mean that peace and harmony are about to break out in the region. Serbia continues to face one huge, unresolved issue ¨C the constitutional mess surrounding Kosovo, which has been recognised as independent by most EU countries but which Serbia and one or two allies refuse to accept. Although Serbia and Kosovo are engaged in exploratory talks to overcome these difficulties, at the moment the two sides seem to be extremely far apart.

But that is overwhelmingly a political issue. What Boris Tadi? has done with Mladi? is to take a huge step towards the moral rehabilitation of Serbs and Serbia whose reputation was so catastrophically compromised by the wars of the 1990s. He deserves our support and respect.










Doctors in Serbia are assessing the health of genocide suspect Ratko Mladic before he can resume his appearance at an extradition hearing which is expected to transfer him to a war crimes tribunal in The Hague.

Europe's most wanted war crimes suspect was undergoing medical tests in Belgrade to determine the length of sessions he could face, according to media reports. Mladic was said to be "in poor physical state" after his arrest in a north Serbian village 16 years after commanding the worst atrocity on the continent since the Nazi era.

His speech was said to be slurred but coherent. Mladic, reported to have suffered strokes in the past and be paralysed in one arm, is expected to face continuous health checks during the extradition process, which is likely to last at least six days.

War crimes prosecutors hoped Mladic would appear before the examining judge again on Friday to complete the first stage of the extradition process. This will be followed by a three-day gap and Mladic will have three days after that to decide whether to appeal. The Serbian ministry of justice will then determine the extradition request. Authorities in The Hague expect Mladic to be there next week and will give him a full medical examination.

Mladic is waiting on the approval of the Belgrade judge to let his family visit him. His wife, Bosiljka, was seen entering the court building in Belgrade this morning, media reported.

The surprise arrest of Mladic, who is wanted for the mass murder of almost 8,000 men and boys in Srebrenica, turned a page in the history of the Balkans, offering Serbia closure on decades as a virtual international pariah and giving the country a chance to take its place as a pivotal regional democracy eventually anchored in the European Union.

The 69-year-old retired general, who commanded the Bosnian Serb military during the 1992-95 war and earned a fearsome reputation as the "butcher of Bosnia", was taken to a special court pending extradition after being arrested at a cousin's home in Lazarevo, north-east of Belgrade.

When Mladic appeared in court he looked frail and walked slowly. He wore a baseball cap and could be heard on state TV saying "good day" to those present.

Mladic's lawyer said the judge cut short the questioning because the suspect's "poor physical state" left him unable to communicate. "He is aware he is under arrest, he knows where he is, and he said he does not recognise The Hague tribunal," Milos Saljic said.

The deputy war crimes prosecutor Bruno Vekaric said Mladic was taking a lot of medicine, but "responds very rationally to everything that is going on".

Announcing the arrest of Mladic, President Boris Tadic said: "We have lifted the stain from Serbia and from Serbs wherever they live. We have ended a difficult period in our history."

More details have emerged of the capture of Mladic, who had been living under the alias Milorad Komadic. According to officials in Belgrade and accounts to the Serbian media, Mladic wore no disguise and put up no resistance when detained by the Serbian security services and Serbian war crimes unit. "I am the person you are looking for," he reportedly said when arrested in part of a cottage once occupied by the now dead parents of his cousin Branko Mladic.

He is said to have been dressed in multiple layers of clothing, including pullovers, although it is summer in Serbia. He had his own identity card, although it formally expired in 1999. There were two guns at the property. Asked why Mladic did not resist arrest, his lawyer is reported to have said the officers were "just children", in other words very young.

Reports about his life there differ. One version holds that he spent a lot of time indoors, while one 20-year-old has claimed to a newpaper that he had worked for a time in the nearby industrial town of Zrenjanin.

After his arrest, Mladic indicated that he had been following media reports of the war crimes prosecutors' long pursuit of him.

President Tadic, who has been taking the credit for Mladic's arrest, insisted to CNN that claims his government knew where Mladic was hiding were "rubbish".

"I will reiterate once again that we have worked very hard in order to arrest him and finally managed to do that."

On Thursday night residents took to the streets to show their support for Mladic, singing Serbian nationalist songs. "To us, Mladic is a hero, a military hero," said one, who would only give his name as Paul. "He protected us from Croatia, Bosnia Herzegovina, even Slovenia. He saved our families."

The image of a frail and sickly rural retiree was a far cry from the strutting, imperious commander of the 1990s who was a monstrous figure to the Muslims of Bosnia. His name is synonymous with the Srebrenica massacre of July 1995 when Mladic's forces overran the Bosnian Muslim "safe haven" hill town, then methodically rounded up the males and murdered almost 8,000.

The arrest represents a huge boost to Serbia's attempts to move on from a violent past and to try to catch up with other parts of the Balkans in the race towards integration in the European Union and possibly Nato.











Visiting his ancestral home in Moneygall, Ireland, this week Barack Obama announced that the Guinness tastes better in Ireland than anywhere else in the world.

"The first time I had Guinness," Obama said, "is when I came to the Shannon airport. We were flying into Afghanistan and so stopped in Shannon. It was the middle of the night. And I tried one of these and I realised it tastes so much better here than it does in the States ... You're keeping all the best stuff here!"

Maybe he's right. According to research published in the Journal of Food Science in March, Guinness does not travel well.

Like all great funny stories to come out of a pub, it started with an Irishman, an Englishman, a Dutchman and a German walking into bars. They spent a year of their spare time (probably quite happily) testing the stout in 14 different countries.

During what the authors lightheartedly describe as "extensive pre-testing", a number of factors that might be involved in making the perfect pint were considered. This included such things as the height of the head on the pint, its temperature and its flavour.

In addition, to capture the entire experience, factors such as the temperature of the pub, the sex and nationality of the bartenders, their level of experience and pint-pulling technique were also considered.

They were certainly thorough. Even the presence or absence of female company was considered: it turned out that having women drinking companions did not "inflict any unplanned blinding of the testers, who were all dedicated to the measurements".

From the variables measured, the authors were able to score each pint using a specially designed Guinness Overall Enjoyment Score (GOES) which allowed the drinking experience in different countries to be compared. They used what is known as Student's t-test: a relatively simple way of establishing whether there are significant differences between two groups of data, in this case, between pints in Ireland and pints consumed outside Ireland.

This is particularly apt, given that the t-test was developed at the Guinness brewery in Dublin by one William Sealy Gossett. In 1908, Gossett developed the test to monitor and improve the average annual yield of barley. Due to the competitive advantage using the test could provide over other brewers, Guinness was reluctant to let Gossett publish the work under his own name, so he used the pseudonym Student.

The results of the Guinness-tasting t-test were clear. Pints consumed in Ireland had a mean GOES score of 74, compared with a score of 57 in pubs outside Ireland. While Ireland may not necessarily keep the best stuff to itself, the science is clear: Guinness tastes better over here.

Efforts to put Europe's most-wanted war crimes suspect on trial in the Hague have crossed their first hurdle with a Belgrade court ruling that Ratko Mladic is fit to be extradited. A spokeswoman said the court determined Mladic was well enough to stand trial despite claims from his defence team that the 69-year old is in poor health.

The ruling clears the way for Mladic to be transfered to the international criminal tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, where he faces 15 charges including genocide and murder.

Mladic's defence team has three days to launch an appeal, which is likely to focus on his health.

The former general's son has said Mladic is too ill for extradition after suffering two strokes while on the run. "We are almost certain he cannot be extradited in such condition," Darko Mladic told reporters after visiting his father in the Belgrade prison where he is being held.

"He is in very bad shape. His right arm is half paralysed. His right side is partly numb." Darko Mladic said the family had requested a transfer to a military hospital. The family called on Russia to send an independent medical team to examine him and guarantee the impartiality of any medical assessment.

Mladic, who earned a fearsome reputation as the "butcher of Bosnia", was brought before the court on Friday after his arrest in a north Serbian village 16 years after commanding the worst atrocity on the continent since the Nazi era.

Darko Mladic refused to discuss any events during the 16-year period his father was in hiding, but said the former Serbian military commander denied the charges against him. "His stand is that he's not guilty of what he's being accused of," he said.

Russia strongly opposed the 1999 Nato airstrikes against Serbia over Kosovo. It has called for Mladic to recieve a fair trial and said the case should not be used by the Yugoslavia tribunal in The Hague to justify prolonging its work.

"There are doubts that the trial of Mladic in the UN war crimes tribunal will be 100% objective and just," said Konstantin Kosachyov, who heads the international affairs committee in Russia's parliament.

War crimes prosecutors are hoping Mladic will appear before the examining judge again on Friday to complete the first stage of the extradition process. This stage will be followed by a three-day gap, after which Mladic will have three days to decide whether to appeal. The Serbian ministry of justice will then determine the extradition request. Authorities in The Hague expect Mladic to be there next week and have said he will receive a full medical examination.

Mladic is wanted for the mass murder of almost 8,000 men and boys in Srebrenica. His surprise arrest turned a page in the history of the Balkans, offering Serbia closure on decades as a virtual international pariah and giving the country a chance to take its place as a pivotal regional democracy eventually anchored in the European Union.

The 69-year-old retired general, who commanded the Bosnian Serb military during the 1992-95 war, was taken to Belgrade after being arrested at a cousin's home in Lazarevo, north-east of Belgrade.

When Mladic appeared in court on Thursday night he looked frail and walked slowly. He wore a baseball cap and could be heard on state TV saying "good day" to those present.

Mladic's lawyer said the judge cut short the questioning because the suspect's "poor physical state" left him unable to communicate. "He is aware he is under arrest, he knows where he is, and he said he does not recognise The Hague tribunal," Milos Saljic said.

The deputy war crimes prosecutor Bruno Vekaric said Mladic was taking a lot of medicine but "responds very rationally to everything that is going on".

Protesters who have camped out in Spanish squares for the past 12 days clashed with police for the first time on Friday after authorities dismantled a camp in the centre of Barcelona.

Police and clean-up trucks moved into the Pla?a de Catalunya, with about 200 protesters being corralled peacefully in the centre of the square.

Protesters were told they were not being evicted and would be allowed back, but municipal workers took away tents, mattresses, tarpaulins, computers and materials used to build the camp.

Trouble erupted when thousands of supporters arrived and blocked access roads. Police cleared routes out of the square by using batons, reportedly injuring 99 people and arresting two.


Video footage filmed in the square shows bloodied demonstrators being beaten by police. Protesters said police also used pepper spray and rubber bullets.

The Catalan regional government said it ordered police into the square only so it could be cleaned.

Authorities were reportedly concerned that the camp might be a focus for violence on Saturday night when crowds of people are expected to take to Barcelona's streets if the city's football team wins the Champions League final against Manchester United.

Demonstrators were allowed into the square after the clean-up and immediately started to rebuild the camp. A peaceful demonstration against the police action has been called for this evening in Barcelona, Madrid and dozens more cities where protesters are camped out in squares.

The clean-up came after authorities came under increased pressure from shop owners and local officials to remove the camps throughout Spain, but protesters said they would stay in place until Sunday at the earliest.










Likened by critics to an island marooned in the Middle Ages, Malta may take a step into the 21st century on Saturday when voters take part in a historic referendum on whether to allow divorce.

If the Catholic church has its way, Malta will vote no, leaving it the only country in Europe and one of only two countries in the world to ban a couple's right to dissolve their marriage.

"Marriage was created by God, Jesus ruled out divorce and we are therefore telling the faithful to vote no," said the archbishop of Malta, Paolo Cremona, who can rely on over half of the island's 400,000 inhabitants showing up at mass.

"Little old ladies are being refused communion if they admit to wanting divorce," said Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, the MP who has co-authored the draft divorce law. "We are on a different planet out here, the victims of spiritual terrorism," he said. "People's jobs have been threatened and they are reluctant to speak out."

"I am living on an island where people go to church and oppose divorce but have affairs," said a female civil servant. "Men in Malta are often happier having a mistress than a wife."

For weeks Malta has been plastered with posters showing a picture of a child alongside the slogan: "I trust you with my future ¨C Vote No."

But, says office manager Mario Fava, 37, who has been legally separated for seven years with no chance of remarrying, a generation of Maltese children are feeling the fallout from the ban.

"Lots of people want to start new relationships and have children, but are forced to do it out of wedlock, and you see their kids being teased at school," he said.

Orlando said that about 30% of Maltese children are now born out of wedlock thanks to the breakdown rate in marriages.

"I have been called an anarchist for starting this referendum, even though the draft law is about the world's most restrictive divorce legislation, with four years of separation required before divorce," said Orlando. If the vote passes, the bill will go before parliament.

"The hypocrisy of the no voters is incredible," added Orlando. "Many are separated men cohabiting with a new partner who like not being remarried so they can dump the woman at the drop of a hat."

Malta was occupied by Arab invaders in the 10th century before mounting a fierce fightback against an Ottoman siege in 1565. A century and a half of British rule, which ended in 1964, put an Anglo-Saxon stamp on the culture but left Malta a strongly Catholic country.

Orlando said the church's reasons to halt divorce are also rather worldly. "This is about protecting the church courts that offer annulment as an alternative to divorce," he said.

Catholic church courts can rule that a religious marriage was never valid, due to a reluctance or inability by one partner to have children or for other reasons.

"About 8% of marriages here are annulled, allowing the ecclesiastical tribunals to take precedence over the state," said Orlando. "It's about church power."

Chris Gherxi, a separated restaurant owner who said he would like to "start again, but legally," also had his doubts about the church's priorities.

"What is the difference between an annulment and a divorce? With divorce introduced the church would lose a lot of money in legal fees."









On Saturday, the Maltese people go to the ballot box to decide whether or not their country should make divorce legal.

Malta and the Philippines are the only two countries left in the world where divorce remains unavailable, with the exception of Vatican City. Marriage laws have been a politically contentious issue in the island nation for decades. While it is currently not possible for Maltese courts to dissolve a marriage, divorces obtained by citizens overseas are legally recognised, which is not the case in the Philippines. Those unable to seek a divorce elsewhere have two alternatives. Legal separation enables the division of shared property but partners cannot remarry. Annulment allows for this possibility but then the couple's own marriage is considered to have never existed. They need to show that it was invalid from the start.

Saturday's referendum will ask voters to say whether they agree with the introduction of divorce if a couple have been living apart for a minimum of four years, all avenues for reconciliation have been exhausted and the interests of children and dependents are protected. The referendum is nonbinding and MPs will then be asked to vote for or against it in the legislature. The debate is generally divided along party lines, with the ruling Nationalist party speaking out against divorce and the Labour party in favour, but leaders of both parties have promised MPs a free vote on an issue that is considered a matter of moral conscience in Malta.

It is no coincidence that both Malta and the Philippines are strongly Catholic nations and the church's position on the divorce referendum has been clear, with pamphlets being sent out to Maltese homes stressing that Christ would not allow remarriage and that divorce is socially harmful. Such material has the potential to seriously influence the outcome of the vote in a country where 98% of people identify themselves as Catholic.

The Maltese church's official stance is to abstain from campaign debates but in reality its voice has been clearly heard. One parish priest erected a billboard that showed a man injecting a child with a needle beside the message: "Divorce: a sickness injected in the minds of youths," although he was quickly ordered to remove it by the archbishop of Malta. Meanwhile, billboards funded by a lay Catholic campaign group that show the face of Jesus and read "Christ Yes, Divorce No" have remained prominently displayed because they are not directly linked to the church. Warnings have also come from outside the country, with one independent American researcher telling the Catholic News Agency that if Malta chose to legislate for divorce it "would open the door to radical Islam" by showing signs of religious weakness.

More worryingly, it has been suggested that some individuals in positions of authority have used their influence to intimidate believers. Several prominent figures have repeatedly warned that divorce is forbidden by Christ and the moral code of the church. One bishop reportedly labelled those in favour of divorce "criminals" who are not entitled to receive the Eucharist. Others have claimed that a number of local priests refused to grant absolution to parishioners who were planning to vote yes to divorce.

These are the actions of individuals rather than an organised campaign on the part of the Maltese church. Notably, one friar has publicly expressed his concern about how the issue has been handled over recent months and another has stressed that Maltese law must see to the needs of all its citizens, Catholic or otherwise. Nonetheless, the impact of such actions is still being felt. Figures within the church ¨C like anyone else ¨C have the right to clarify their position on divorce but this must be done responsibly. Whether the answer is yes or no, the outcome of the referendum must reflect what the Maltese people believe to be most beneficial to their society and not the result of what one politician apparently referred to as "spiritual terrorism".









From the outside looking in, the high walls of Scheveningen prison house some of the nastiest individuals ever assembled in one place.

More than 40 men are accused of the gravest crimes possible, from genocide and the premeditated slaughter of innocents to the torching of villages and the indiscriminate shelling of towns.

From the inside looking out, however, the remand centre for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia on the Dutch North Sea coast seems to be a relaxed and comfortable hothouse of creativity, a veritable university of amateur learning. There is art and sport, poetry and painting, gourmet cooking, guitars and song.

The detainees made their names stirring up ethnic hatred ¨C Serb against Croat, Croat against Bosnian Muslim, Macedonian against Albanian, Albanian against Serb ¨C in a cycle of killing and persecution that raged from 1991 to 1999 and destroyed Yugoslavia.

But behind the barbed wire of Scheveningen a little piece of Yugoslavia survives, with former warlords, police chiefs and politicians mixing together in a multi-ethnic stew with few problems. They lend one another clothes and books, cook for each other and reminisce about the old days when they exercised terrible power.

"It's very rare that there are any ethnic tensions," said a tribunal official.

"The prison environment is a very interesting one," Ljube Bo?koski, a former Macedonian interior minister, revealed recently to a Croatian journalist. "Before going to prison I never imagined that I could paint something. But here you can see mostly my works; the works of a student of The Hague school."

The new boy enrolling in The Hague school is Ratko Mladic, the Bosnian Serb general awaiting extradition to the Netherlands to face charges of genocide and crimes against humanity. A Serbian judge has ruled that Mladic is fit to be sent to The Hague. He will appeal on Monday on health grounds.

If he arrives in the red-brick building in Holland next week the 69-year-old will have a laptop (but probably no internet access), a coffee-machine, family and conjugal visits, massage on request and satellite TV in his room beaming up from the Balkans.

Free to wander the compound from early morning to early evening, Mladic will renew his long double act with fellow Bosnian Serb leader, genocide suspect, and former chess partner Radovan Karadzic. In all likelihood Mladic will join Karadzic in the dock in courtroom No 1 of the former insurance company building that is the tribunal in The Hague, a five-minute drive from his North Sea cell.

They might be accused of unspeakable crimes, but Mladic's peers are ¨C on paper ¨C a high-calibre bunch, including over the years a president, a prime minister, defence ministers, interior ministers, and army and intelligence chiefs. The average age of the class of 2011 is 57 ¨C much higher than in a normal prison.

The nationalities are mixed across the five floors of cells as a matter of policy, say tribunal officials, to try to prevent ethnic minority plotting and hostilities or the formation of tribal mafias.

When Ante Gotovina, a Croatian general recently sentenced to 24 years for persecuting Serbs, arrived in Scheveningen in 2005, his erstwhile arch-enemy, the former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, lent him a pullover because he was cold, according to Ljube Boskovski who spent three years there before being acquitted of war crimes.

Among the lessons the Macedonian learned as an accomplished cook was to discard the cores of garlic cloves as they cause indigestion. There were also loftier lessons. "We connected through cooking and the classics of world art, poetry. We had lots to talk about in our little cells in The Hague. We swapped recipes."

Mladic is said to have been cheeky when taken to Belgrade's special court on Thursday for formal identification and questioning, evincing contempt for Bruno Vekaric, a Serbian war crimes prosecutor, and making scathing remarks about his beard.

The chutzpah will be amplified internationally in The Hague where Mladic is almost certain to refuse to acknowledge the tribunal's authority, decline defence lawyers, indulge in time-wasting theatrics and insult and intimidate witnesses, who will be subjected to the ordeal of revisiting the terror Mladic inspired in them in the 1990s.

This is all a well-established routine in The Hague. Milosevic, the late Serbian president, spent four years seeking to invalidate the court before dying in custody in Scheveningen.

Karadzic and Vojislav Seselj, an extreme Serbian nationalist and former paramilitary leader, are currently performing to the same clownish script.

The judges, some of whom struggle to display any detailed knowledge of the Balkans or of the events they are reviewing, will be under strong pressure to get a grip and not allow the accused to dictate the terms and timetable of his own trial.

There was much criticism that the Milosevic trial was allowed to drag on too long and remained inconclusive.

The Mladic trial will be the climax to a tribunal set up in 1993 and that the powers behind it want closed down by 2014 at the latest.









The Citigroup tower has been put up for sale with a ¡ê1bn price tag by cash-strapped Irish developer, Derek Quinlan.
Ireland's "bad bank", the National Asset Management Agency (Nama), is to ditch all its London property by 2013 in what could be the biggest ever fire sale of trophy buildings in the UK capital.

It will sell or refinance the entire portfolio of properties it controls after being charged with getting rid of the debt mountain amassed by developers during Ireland's disastrous property boom. Among the buildings set for disposal or for refinancing are the Citigroup Tower in Canary Wharf, the Louis Vuitton shop on Bond Street and the landmark 23 Savile Row office block in Mayfair.

With some €19bn (¡ê16.5bn) in its charge, Nama is now one of the key property owners in London with assets throughout the city. Its property portfolio includes the Odeon Cinema site in Leicester Square, the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Shoreditch, a shopping centre in Ealing and at least half a dozen blocks of flats in Docklands.

Graham Emmett, head of lending and corporate finance at the agency, told Property Week: "The UK is a more liquid real estate market structurally than Ireland and, with 27% of the loan portfolio here, this is where we can achieve our near-term aim of repaying 25% of the Nama bonds by 2013. Thus we plan to try and exit the UK exposures in the next two to three years, through borrower-led asset sales and refinancing."

The trade paper described the development as "one of the most dramatic sales the market has ever seen".

The decision to quit London is a U-turn for the agency, which hitherto indicated it would hold on to London properties and go for an orderly sale over seven to 10 years to benefit from the rising market. The agency's chief executive, Brendan McDonagh, said last month it would seek to dispose of just 25% of its UK portfolio by 2013.

But the leading commercial property firm DTZ said Nama was making a wise move amid fears that the value of its Irish portfolio, down by 50% in places, could be battered even further.

"You've got to remember Nama has a duty to the taxpayer and it has to get a return. There has been a lot of uncertainty over the last two or three years and I think they've said quite rightly, let's get on with it and get some loot in. Their view is the UK market is strong," he said. There is a drought of good quality property in the market and NAMA would do well, he said.

Fergus Keane, head of West End investment at DTZ, said: "There's no such thing as a fire sale in London, nothing's cheap. The story isn't everything must go, but everything will go and at top price."

Nama bought the properties at a discounted price of about €9bn and has recouped €3.3bn from sale or refinancing deals that include Claridge's hotel and Battersea power station which was refinanced this month in a debt-for-equity swap. Much of the property was bought on the back of cheap credit from Irish banks, and now the property developers and investors who once enjoyed a high life of private jets, helicopters and second, third and fourth homes are under pressure.

Nama refuses to specify which properties it has but it is understood that the owner of the block housing Louis Vuitton is David Daly, a low-profile Dublin developer. David Daly. David Arnold, another Dubliner, has also had his business, D2 Private, absorbed into Nama. It is behind four prize London assets including 23 Savile Row, Paddington Waterside, Woolgate Exchange in the East End and 12 St James's Square.

The developer who took the most spectacular fall is the tax inspector turned property investor Derek Quinlan. He was forced to sell the "style mile" of shop space between Harrods and Harvey Nichols in Knightsbridge, which houses several top fashion chains. Elsewhere, he has also been forced to put his Citigroup tower in Canary Wharf up for sale with a ¡ê1bn price tag . Another high-profile Nama developer is Ray Grehan, who this month saw his London portfolio put into administration. The for-sale sign will go up on his assets, which include the 196-bed Crowne Plaza hotel in Shoreditch and two developments in the Docklands including a 128-flat block called the Forge in Canary Wharf and a proposed 62-storey residential and hotel tower, designed by Foster & Partners on the site of the City Pride pub near South Quay. Another property owned by Grehanis Ealing Arcadia, a retail park in Ealing Broadway.

Others that will be affected are Ballymore, which has about 60 sites around the capital, with half a dozen residential towers in Docklands including Pan Peninsula and Baltimore Wharf. It has recently sold ¡ê350m worth of land to reduce debt and is believed to have more than ¡ê500m in Nama. It has agreed with Nama to cut its borrowings through debt for equity deals.










According to the popular interpretation of recent events, most Serbs think of Ratko Mladi? as a war hero, and do not believe that the Srebrenica massacre happened. Or do they?

For many years, the whole of Serbia has fallen into the trap of being defined by the deficiencies of its leaders. This has especially been the case with war crimes: analysts, academics and journalists have often assumed that Serbia as a whole is failing to confront its past and is in denial of the atrocities committed.

In fact, many Serbs have welcomed the arrest because they believe (and have done for a long time) that Mladi? is responsible for the siege of Sarajevo and the Srebrenica massacre. Those who support Mladi? enough to protest against his arrest are in a minority. For a lot of people, Mladi? has come to be a burden and a symbol of a very dark past and the main obstacle to future progress.

At the same time, his arrest was received with a lot of cynicism ¨C very few people in Serbia actually believe that this will bring about any real change in the country. For most of them, the Mladi? arrest has been a media spectacle, but their own stance towards the arrest has been one of indifference because the majority of people in Serbia today are simply too preoccupied with the most basic existential concerns ¨C poverty and unemployment are acute problems here.

This is not to say that they are indifferent towards the victims and atrocities: these matters are deeply disturbing to many people in Serbia. But dealing with the past is much more complicated than the arrest of one man.

What complicates matters is that, while large numbers of people do think of Mladi? as a war criminal, they do not believe he should be tried at the war crimes tribunal at The Hague, and certainly that he should not be transferred for the sake of EU membership. In Serbia, this has for a long time been interpreted as a kind of blackmail and has often been met with resentment and perceived bias on the part of international justice: why, people ask, are we required to hand over our war crimes suspects, but "others" are not?

People will often point to former wartime leaders such as Bosnian Naser Ori? or Kosovan Albanian Hasim Tha?i, whom they believe to have both escaped justice. Two processes are at play here: the perception that crimes committed against the Serbs have gone unrecognised and unpunished, while at the same time, people are still shocked and troubled that massacres such as Srebrenica have been committed.

Perhaps, yet again, this incident has illustrated that, while legislative processes requiring someone indicted for war crimes to appear in court may be relatively straightforward, the process which societies of the Balkans need to engage in to talk about the atrocities of the past is messy, emotionally difficult and tinged with unacknowledged resentments on all sides.

Thankfully, the civil society in the western Balkans understands this. In response to politicisation of the war crimes debate, some 1,500 regional non-governmental organisations have started an initiative for the establishment of a truth and reconciliation commission. Perhaps the responses to the Mladi? arrest will remind us of the urgent need to bring people from the Balkans together in this way.










Ratko Mladic in Belgrade on Thursday. The judge has given Mladic three days to appeal against his extradition to face charges over war crimes Link to this video
Ratko Mladic, the former Bosnian Serb general charged with orchestrating the murder of tens of thousands of Balkan Muslims, has been ruled fit for extradition to face international justice after the capture that ended his 16 years as a fugitive.

Brought before a special Belgrade court a day after being arrested in a dawn raid on a country cottage north-east of the Serbian capital, Mladic dismissed the 15 counts of genocide and war crimes against him, while his lawyer and family insisted he was too ill to be extradited for trial at the UN war crimes tribunal in the Hague. They asked for him to be hospitalised in Belgrade and treated by a team of Russian doctors.

Following a medical examination, however, the Belgrade judge ruled that the 69-year-old was fit to be transferred to the Yugoslav tribunal in The Hague. The judge gave Mladic three days to appeal. Bruno Vekaric, a Serbian war crimes prosecutor, said the extradition could be completed within a week. A panel of judges is expected to hear the appeal on Monday before the Serbian justice minister decides whether to put Mladic on a flight to the Netherlands.

Doctors, family, lawyers and a Serbian government minister went on Friday to the detention unit where Mladic. They talked to the genocide suspect, who is said to have been in robust form when questioned on Thursday.

Brusquely rejecting the charges against him, he turned on Vekaric, made rude remarks about his beard and refused to sign a statement. Mladic was put on suicide watch and had medicines and his spectacles taken away.

"Are you frightened I'm going to kill myself? Mladic won't do Mladic," he told his guards, according to the Belgrade newspaper Blic quoting court sources.

His son, Darko Mladic, said after visiting the suspect twice on Friday: "His stand is that he's not guilty of what he's being accused of.

"He has received a medical examination and is under medical observation, but we think that's not enough because of his condition. From what we saw his state of health is worrying. We are demanding that he be transferred to hospital and we want a team of doctors from Russia."

His son added that the doctors had evidence of two strokes. The court spokesman, Maja Kovacevic, agreed Mladic was ill but said he was capable of understanding the proceedings and was fit to go to The Hague, where medical treatment would be available.

As details began to emerge of the operation to seize Mladic, questions were being asked about why the Serbian authorities, under intense international pressure, had taken so long to locate him.

Ivica Dacic, the Serbian interior minister, said Mladic had been living for years in the small Vojvodina village of Lazarevo, north-east of Belgrade.

Dacic said that when a special police unit seized Mladic early on Thursday and asked him to identify himself, he replied: "Congratulations, you've found who you are looking for."

On Friday in the Serbian half of Bosnia, protests at the arrest began to multiply. Posters of Mladic with the slogan "Serbs arise" appeared across Banja Luka, the Bosnian Serb capital, and demonstrations were announced in Pale and Han Pijesak, the wartime political and military headquarters of Mladic and Radovan Karadzic, also being tried on genocide charges.

The Mladic arrest is seen as a coup for Serbia's President Boris Tadic, who pressed the European Union to reward him by naming a date for starting talks on Serbia's membership. But in what is seen as a missed opportunity, Tadic is boycotting a summit of east European leaders with Barack Obama because the president of Kosovo, which Belgrade refuses to recognise as independent, will be there.










G8 summit: Russian president Dmitry Medvedev¡¯s condemnation of Gaddafi delighted his G8 counterparts. Photograph: Damien Meyer/AFP
Colonel Gaddafi has beenleft diplomatically deserted after Russia, his sole international interlocutor joined the rest of the G8 nations in declaring the Libyan leader had lost all legitimacy and had to go.

But continuing differences between Russia and the west prevented agreement on how to pressurise the Syrian regime to end its oppression; a planned reference to take the issue to the UN security council was removed from the G8 communique.

On Libya, David Cameron claimed there would be no attempt to reach a compromise deal, saying the only message to the Libyan leader was that he had to give up power. Cameron, who held a council of war with Barack Obama and Nicolas Sarkozy on Thursday night, claimed the war against Gaddafi was entering a second phase and the pressure on the regime was beginning to tell.

There had been suggestions that the Russians would act as some kind of mediator in trying to secure a peace deal with Gaddafi, but Cameron said the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, had not made this suggestion in the discussions he had had with them.

Cameron said: "The most important thing is to send the same message down the pipe when one of these offers appears and the message is that Gaddafi has to go. All sorts of things can happen after that. All offers of mediation should be met with that pretty clear response."

He said the Tripoli regime was beginning to feel the heat, revealing: "There is a whole string of contacts taking place, of phone calls and faxes coming out saying 'how do we get out of this, what do we about this?' to which I say there is one clear response: Gaddafi has to go."

Sarkozy revealed he had been discussing a joint visit with Cameron to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi, but Cameron's aides played down the prospect of an imminent trip.

Sarkozy also highlighted the terms of the communique, saying: "There is unanimous support for this objective and the terms used against Gaddafi are particularly clear and hard and accepted by all the G8 countries including Russia."

In unusually simple language for a G8 communique, the leaders of the industrialised west said: "Gaddafi and the Libyan government have failed to fulfil their responsibility to protect the Libyan population and have lost all legitimacy. He has no future in a free, democratic Libya. He must go.

"We welcome the work of the international criminal court in investigating crimes in Libya and note the chief prosecutor's request on 16 May for three arrest warrants." The Russians said they would send a delegation to Benghazi, but would not accept Gaddafi into exile.

Cameron conceded the communique was less clear on Syria, admitting that the Arab world was divided as to whether President Bashar al-Assad might yet take the fork in the road towards reconciliation.

Sarkozy was more blunt: "The situation is perfectly unacceptable and the attitude of the powers in the country is shocking. We have done everything we can to bring Syria into the international community. We have tried to help, to advise, to understand ¡­ sadly the leaders are going firmly backwards and we have withdrawn our confidence and criticised what has to be criticised."

The shift in the communique language to a vaguer threat of "further measures" appeared to be driven by Russia, which has a security council veto and has been upset by the way in which the west has interpreted its right to bomb Gaddafi following an earlier UN resolution giving Nato all necessary powers to protect civilians.

"There are no grounds to consider this issue [Syria] in the UN security council," Russia's deputy foreign minister, Sergei Ryabkov, told reporters. He said a draft resolution circulated to the 15-nation council on Wednesday by Britain, France, Germany and Portugal was "untimely and damaging", adding: "We will not even read the text." The draft resolution could also face a Chinese veto.

The language on Libya by contrast at the G8 will be seen as a victory for Sarkozy, suggesting he managed to persuade a reluctant Russian delegation to bury their doubts about the scale of the military offensive, including the decision by the French and British to provide ground attack helicopters for use by Nato.

In other parts of the communique the language on Libya is less robust, stating: "We are committed to supporting a political transition that reflects the will of the Libyan people. We recall our strong commitment to the sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and national unity of Libya."

Elsewhere in the communique, the leaders of the biggest industrialised countries also claim "the world economy is recovering", even if more needs to be done to reduce global imbalances and deficits.










An Air France jet that crashed into the Atlantic claiming 228 lives dropped 38,000 feet (11,600 metres) in three and a half minutes before slamming belly first into the ocean, according to investigators.

French air accident experts published a chilling chronology of events that showed the three Air France pilots battling to regain control on flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris in a heavy thunderstorm on the morning of 1 June 2009.

Air France acknowledged that the disaster was triggered by faulty speed sensors, with one of the pilots exclaiming "we have no valid indications" as the Airbus A330 fell at 10,000ft a minute. Moments before the crash, one of the pilots, again unnamed, reportedly shouted "Je ne comprends rien" ("I don't understand a thing").

Air safety specialists have been baffled by the loss of AF447, but the causes have become clearer since its black boxes were discovered two and a half miles underwater this month.

According to the BEA, the French air accident investigation agency, one of the pilots called the cabin crew two hours and six minutes into the flight to tell them: "In two minutes we should enter an area where it'll move about a bit more than at the moment, you should watch out." Just over eight minutes later everyone on board was dead following a descent that, according to experts, none of the passengers would have noticed.

"The aeroplane probably felt more or less under control. The passengers probably would have felt their ears popping as it descended but the aircraft was held in a consistent pattern until it hit the sea," said Guy Gratton of Brunel University and a member of the Royal Aeronautical Society.

The report states that the experienced captain, Marc Dubois, 58, was resting when the Airbus began encountering difficulties, but had been present at a briefing with co-pilots David Robert, 37, and Pierre-Cedric Bonin, 32, shortly beforehand, when they discussed the turbulence ahead. The plane was flying towards a large storm system, a common obstacle on that route.

The pilot flying the plane at the time, who was not identified by the BEA, said: "The little bit of turbulence that you just saw [¡­] we should find the same ahead."

Two hours and 10 minutes into the flight, the computers controlling the flight switched off the autopilot after becoming confused by conflicting speed readings, caused by the icing up of pitot tubes monitoring the plane's velocity.

"There was an inconsistency between the speeds displayed on the left side and the integrated standby instrument system (ISIS). This lasted for less than one minute," the BEA document said.

Unable to calculate speed because monitors were showing an impossible drop from 275 knots to 60 knots, one of the pilots appeared to make a fatal assumption that the plane was flying too fast and was in danger of breaching "coffin corner": the narrow aerodynamic envelope that keeps a plane flying at cruise altitude.

The 37-year-old co-pilot, Robert, then suggested the plane perform a slight turn to the left, which resulted in an increase in turbulence. Two minutes later the plane's serious difficulties became clear as the report describes a flight deck that would have sounded with scores of warning signals as AF447, buffeted by stormclouds and confused by contradictory speed readings, went out of control.

The autopilot disengaged and the pilot took over the controls. In the middle of the night over the Atlantic and buffeted by turbulence, he tried to lift up the plane's nose, in an apparent attempt to slow it down. The A330's stall warning sounded twice, signalling the aerodynamics were not generating enough lift and that AF447 was in danger of losing control, although its twin engines were working normally.

Experts said the pilot was receiving erroneous speed readings although one aviation source said he appeared to contravene standard procedure for a stall which is to pitch the nose down and increase engine thrust.

"You cannot call it pilot error because it may have been caused by reactions to data that was wrong," said Chris Yates, an aviation industry consultant.

At this point the co-pilot was heard saying "we've lost the speeds" and "alternate law", which signals the autopilot has been disengaged.

Seconds later the co-pilot decided to seek the help of Dubois and "tried several times to call the captain back" as another stall warning was issued. To add to the confusion, the speed readings returned to normal but the pilot kept the plane in a nose-up position, slowing it down and keeping the plane in a position where it was not generating enough lift.

By the time the Dubois appeared, just over a minute later, and as the plane began its fatal descent, another stall warning had been issued.

With the plane now rocking and falling at 10,000ft a minute, the pilot acknowledged the terrifying speed of the descent, saying "we're going to arrive at level 100", meaning 10,000ft.

At that point, just over a minute before the recordings stopped, the control sticks were used simultaneously, indicating the battle to control the plane had reached a frantic pitch. The pilot handed control to an unnamed colleague, presumed to be Dubois.

By now the "angle of attack", a critical indication of airflow over the wings, was at more than 35 degrees ¨C nearly triple the outer limits for safe flight.

The BEA said the plane remained stalled throughout its three and a half minute descent, with the last recorded measurement showing the plane plummeting at 10,912ft per minute. Only 51 bodies were found in the immediate aftermath. Among the dead were five Britons and three young Irish doctors.

Air France said on Friday the investigators should be allowed to get on with their inquiry and said its thoughts were with the families of the victims.

In a statement the airline said: "It appears that the crew followed the evolving weather conditions and had changed their route, that the failure of the speed sensors is the initial event that caused the automatic pilot to fail and a loss of the associated flying tools, that the aircraft stalled at high altitude.

"It also appears that the commander on board quickly interrupted his rest to return to the cockpit. The crew fought right to the end to control the plane which is proof of their professionalism and Air France would like to pay its respects to them."

A pilot's analysis

You look at this as an A330 pilot and it's a case of there but for the grace of God. The first sign of trouble was the expectation of turbulence voiced by the first officer. He reduced the speed in anticipation to Mach 0.82, which is normal, and warned the crew. Shortly after entering the turbulence and associated ice, the autopilot disengaged and the first officer commented that the flight control computers had disconnected. This happened because the computers were no longer receiving speed information and neither were the pilots.

I cannot speculate why the pilot climbed the aircraft but it could have been due to confusion caused by the turbulence and sudden instrument failure. The controls at very high altitude are very sensitive and there is only a very small speed envelope, often called "coffin corner", where only a few knots of speed up or down can cause a stall.

So you are flying in this little window of a flight envelope which is perfectly normal and, indeed, you do it every day. But if you are suddenly handed control of an aircraft you can breathe on that little stick and the aircraft can go down one degree. In a very short space of time lost speed and stalled, causing it to fall from the sky. Despite what the pilots must have been going through in the cockpit, the pitch attitude remained fairly constant throughout so the passengers would not have sensed something was seriously wrong. They would have felt mild buffeting of the stalled airflow over the wings and the initial sinking feeling. That's all.

I feel a lot of empathy for the pilots. One could imagine suddenly suffering a total loss of airspeed indication in turbulence in the middle of the night and with all the autopilot systems suddenly failing. The indications, both visual and aural, would have been very confusing. The question for me is why did the instruments that are triple redundant, which means that there are three back-ups, all fail together?









The house where Bosnian Serb wartime general Ratko Mladic was found on Thursday in the village of Lazarevo, close to the northern Serbian town of Zrenjanin. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images
Ratko Mladic's 59-year-old second cousin Branislav ¨C known to all as "Branko" ¨C is wiry and deeply tanned. He emerges through the rusty gates of his home in the northern Serbian village of Lazarevo pushing a trailer, his face furious beneath a dirty pale blue cap pulled over his eyes.

It was in Branko's house that Europe's most wanted war criminal was found by Serbian special police at 5am on Thursday.

Branko, a former television repairman who now ekes out a living by farming, leaves the house accompanied by two other men. One, a heavy-set man in middle age, is pointed out to the Guardian as "Jotosovic", who was in the house with Branko when the Serbian special police came for Ratko Mladic and was asked to help dress him.

On the road outside, the men hook up the trailer to a tractor before leaving without a word. The open gates offer a glimpse of the place in which the man wanted for the massacre at Srebrenica, where 8,000 Muslim men and boys were killed, and the siege of Sarajevo, where 10,000 perished, lived his last days on the run.

Two buildings are visible behind the men, their walls painted a dirty yellow. In one of them lives Branko. In the other, where Branko's late parents once lived, Mladic was found.

Police officials said that they had learned that Mladic had moved into the largely Bosnian Serb village about two years ago, figuring he could be safe with his relatives there.

Mladic was about to venture into the grassy yard for some fresh air, the officials told Associated Press, when four men in masks and black fatigues without insignia jumped over the fence and burst into the house, grabbing the frail-looking man and forcing him to the floor, face down.

"Identify yourself," shouted one of the policemen. Mladic's reply was a whisper. "I'm the one you're looking for," he said, before asking them not to "do something funny". The officers demanded the two guns Mladic was carrying, then the former Serbian general was pushed into a four-wheel drive, which drove full speed out of the village towards Belgrade with dust flying.

"Even though Mladic had two pistols on his person, there was no resistance and he talked with members of the security information agency and other officials in a completely normal and natural manner," Rasim Ljajic, president of the National Council for Co-operation with The Hague Tribunal, told Serbian TV. According to his lawyer, Milos Salic, Mladic said he did not use the guns because those arresting him "were children".

Serbian media had further details. A neighbour who had been called into the house described how Mladic was living in a dark, untidy room provided with ample food, still visible after his arrest, including pizza that he had not apparently had the opportunity to eat.

Even though he lived under the pseudonym "Milorad Komodic", Mladic's ID card, which had expired in 1999, confirmed who he was ¨C the former military commander of the Bosnian Serbs and a man who once said he would rather shoot himself than be taken.

After all the stories of how he used to live openly in Belgrade before the fall of Slobodan Milosevic ¨C almost as a celebrity, going to football matches and restaurants ¨C the last days of Mladic's freedom were spent in very different circumstances.

According to those who raided the house, he was found in conditions close to poverty, frail but coherent with slurred speech from two strokes he is believed to have suffered, one of which left the fingers of one hand immobile.

Even in the heat of the early Serbian summer, Mladic was dressed in layers of clothing to keep him warm. He asked, as he was taken to the headquarters of the BIA, the Serbian intelligence agency, to have a suit sent for him to wear in court. In the end he wore a baseball cap and jacket.

So what is this place, Lazarevo, where Mladic was found? Neighbours said that many living there had relocated to the village after the second world war and regarded their roots as being Bosnian Serb. Now Mladic has gone, those who lived around him are left supplying contradictory stories.

The villagers who will speak to the media appear to have considerable affection for the former fugitive. Some say at first they had no idea that Mladic was living among them. Then they start to tell stories of encounters with him.

One resident says Mladic came to the village during the Bosnian war. Another that he kept bees in the village. A third recalls greeting him in the street and being asked for a drink.

"I never saw him," says Nedleko Arsic, 57, sitting on his bicycle in the shade of the cherry and plum trees outside the house. "But if anyone had seen him here they would have hidden him.

"We'll find out who tipped off the police," he says with a hint of menace. "No one can keep that inside of him. It will all come out."

Arsic is one of those who wants to put up a plaque on Branko's house saying "Ratko Mladic was captured here." Someone has already put a sticker on the road sign at the entrance of the village celebrating it as Mladic's last home before he was found. Some in the village say they would like to name the village after him.

Another neighbour, who does not want to be named, says: "He used to pass by sometimes and say hello. Once I saw a black four-by-four with someone in the back talking on a phone. Someone later said that it was him."

No one criticises Mladic. The angriest say that he was fighting for justice for Serbs during the war; the more "lukewarm" only that he is innocent until proven guilty.

Mladic is suspected of hiding in other parts of Serbia over the years, perhaps moving from safe house to safe house as his former aides and associates in the network that once protected him were gradually rounded up.

All the time ¨C as became clear after his arrest ¨C he followed his own pursuit on television and radio, becoming familiar with the faces of those tasked with finding him.

According to a spokeswoman for the special court, since his capture he has been keen to speak to people involved in the hunt for him.

One of his hideouts is believed to have been in New Belgrade, close to the Chinese market, a place of tall, ugly blocks. Here in apartment 20 at 118 Juri Gagarina Street, a former bodyguard of Mladic, Jovan Djago, testified in court that he had rented the former general a flat between 2003 and 2006, a few minutes' walk from where Radovan Karadzic, Mladic's political boss, was also hiding.

What seems clear now is that his life on the run had become ever more difficult as the government sought more aggressively to be accepted as a candidate for EU membership.

His pension was cancelled, finally, in 2004, and his security detail was wound up. Where once he was allegedly able to visit army offices or even stay in barracks, those hiding holes were blocked, even military facilities searched.

There were raids on his son Darko's Belgrade house, as well as his wife's home and a weekend retreat owned by the family in Divcibare. He was sought in Han Pijesak, in the villages on Zlatibor mountain, in Pancevo and Valjevo, even in Montenegro ¨C and all the while with the suspicion that there were those in the Serbian government who knew precisely where he was.

In the end, only a month before the EU was due to make an initial examination of Serbia's bid for membership, Serbia's president, Boris Tadic ¨C who took personal control of the operation to arrest Mladic ¨C finally laid his hands on him, removing the last serious obstacle.

On Friday some of the old arrogance, familiar from the Bosnian war, appeared to be returning.

At the ending of a closed court hearing to approve his extradition, Belgrade Radio B92 reported that Mladic, who had goaded the prosecutor after his arrest, apologised for his behaviour, and then requested strawberries and a television to be provided in his cell.








Last year, when my daughter was just a few months old, I walked past an open-air exhibition at London's South Bank, a photographic project related to the Srebrenica massacre. On the photographs mothers held hand-written testimonies in creased fists, stories of their lost sons.

Almost 16 years on some bodies have not been found, only clothing and personal objects scattered across mass graves. The bones had been mixed up, the murdered men jumbled together by bulldozers operated by Ratko Mladic's men to make identification more difficult. And though I have always appreciated my fortune at leaving Bosnia alive and healthy ¨C the death of several family members and friends notwithstanding ¨C having a child of my own has opened up an understanding of loss that I now realise was previously incomplete.

With the overwhelming love of one's own children and the life-long preoccupation with their safety, how do you survive in the wake of such brutality as was experienced by the people of Srebrenica? Can you ever heal if you aren't able to hold the body you raised, to have only a dusty shirt in its place? The news of Mladic's arrest tugged at my gut; this has been a long time coming. But I feel no solace.

I left Bosnia at the end of 1992 when Mladic and his forces were still gearing up for their most flamboyant war efforts, though their disregard for human life was already evident. Mladic's voice was broadcast on the radio as he ordered his subordinates, who at the time were positioned around Sarajevo, to pummel only "live flesh", or probably in his ethic "live meat" ¨C the word meso means both. I later saw him on film, uniformed, hatless and plump, speaking from what he called "Serbian Srebrenica" on 11 July 1995. "It's the day," he said, slightly out of breath, the streets behind him ghostly bare, "when I gift this town to the Serb people, as the final revenge on the Turks." That gift was the death of more than 8,000 men, and the dispersion of many more.

The war will always be an integral part of my personal and national history; it's one of my people's ¨C from all three ethnic groups ¨C most potent roots. It's why I'm in London and why my daughter was born here. My life has been formed and hers framed by it. The Bosnian war, and with it the Srebrenica genocide, is part of my daughter's heritage. And the way I will tell her about it one day ¨C the way a mother tells her daughter about her history, whether that memory will be stained with bitterness or a vague sense of justice ¨C depends on the outcome of the trials held at the international Hague tribunal.

In his court appearances Radovan Karadzic is still sticking to his guns, though thankfully not literally; Mladic is likely to do the same, despite his now poor health and providing he ever gets to trial. Slobodan Milosevic died in prison, never having been properly convicted, and Franjo Tudjman and Alija Izetbegovic, the other two key players in the Yugoslavian breakdown, both died free men. Across the tribunal's hearings, remorse from the war criminals has been hard to find.

Mladic stamped his legacy through murder, destruction and a blind hatred based on a perverted interpretation of history. He left behind a country ¨C Bosnia-Herzegovina ¨C permeated by mistrust and corruption, with growing national and religious extremism as its moral compass. And I'm not sure his arrest, and an extended, limping trial, will change that. Serbia will probably benefit from the extradition of Mladic to The Hague by increasing its chances of entering the EU and rehabilitating its international reputation, but Bosnia-Herzegovina and the victims of the Srebrenica genocide still have a long way to go towards recovery.









The arrest of Ratko Mladic is a welcome if long overdue breakthrough (16 years on, the Butcher of Bosnia is behind bars, 27 May). However, the fact that his capture coincided with the visit to Serbia of Baroness Ashton and came just a week after the European commission president, Jos¨¦ Manuel Barroso, told Belgrade to step up its efforts to catch war criminals, does raise some awkward questions. Have the Serbian authorities really been completely unaware of Mladic's whereabouts for 16 years? Does his arrest ¨C like that of Radovan Karadzic in 2008 ¨C have more to do with a political desire for EU membership rather than any investigative breakthrough by the police and Interpol?

Karadzic was found "hiding" in Belgrade in the same week that Serbia reinstated its ambassadors withdrawn from EU countries that recognised Kosovo's independence. Mladic's arrest comes just before the European commission is due to decide whether to declare Serbia a formal candidate for EU membership.

Misha Glenny called the war in the Balkans "a struggle between the rural and the urban, the primitive and the cosmopolitan, and between chaos and reason". Whether coincidence or premeditated, the arrest of Mladic should be welcomed as a victory of reason over chaos.

? I note that the charges against Mladic include "inflicting terror upon civilians". The so-called "shock and awe" tactics employed by Bush, Blair et al upon the people of Baghdad in 2003 is another example of such an atrocity. I look forward to seeing those responsible similarly indicted at The Hague.









With the amazing legacy we have given the world in computing, mathematics, design and web technologies ¨C viz Charles Babbage, Alan Turing, Jonathan Ive and Tim Berners-Lee ¨C we cannot allow America or France to dominate the debates at the G8 about whether or not some regulation is needed for the internet.

Some regulation is needed and Martin Kettle (To want controls on the web may not be cool, but it's right, 27 May) was right to highlight the need to protect children from online pornography. Extraordinarily, this gets short shrift in the US because they hide behind the first amendment of their constitution concerning free speech. Secondly, America loathes signing international agreements or belonging to international organisations which it cannot dominate.

Of course, Google is too close to both the Obama and Cameron administrations and this is not good, much as it wasn't so good a decade ago when Microsoft was in a similar position. Their speakers speak for Google, not for the rights of citizens using their services. Currently, the internet is the responsibility of a worn-out organisation known as the WTO. We need to give it a new home. Given our legacy and the soft power we wield around the world with our Open University, the British Council and the BBC World Service, it is time we came together to create a similar body for the internet. The world will thank us for it.

? Your article on use of Facebook by under-13s (Should kids be allowed on Facebook?, G2, 26 May) makes interesting reading. Here in the north-east, we have the absurd situation where Northumberland county council has banned the use of Facebook and all blogs, including your own Comment is Free site. I believe it is only one of a handful of local councils to do so. I have been in a situation where I cannot access work-related material as it is on a blog and is filtered out. While I would not want my seven-year-old accessing Facebook, it is absurd that just down the road in Gateshead, Facebook, WordPress, etc, are freely available to adult users.

Every payment, the location, time, amount, retailer and possibly other information will be tracked and held by the company. While loyalty card schemes are not dissimilar, the breadth of information Google gathers will increase the surveillance of our everyday lives. No doubt Google profits from this/our information.

The growing gulf between Spain's PSOE government and its population is not likely to close after Zapatero steps down as prime minister, as is expected to take place shortly. His now very likely successor is the government's "strongman" ¨C seen by some as the most able to push through unpopular austerity.

Despite the conservative Popular party's success in last Sunday's municipal and regional elections, there is little evidence that Spaniards want a more rightwing administration. The centre-left PSOE lost three times more votes than the Popular party gained ¨C hardly an endorsement of the latter. Furthermore, surveys continually detect hostility towards both parties and politicians in general. In an April survey, over 46% of interviewees said they "strongly distrusted" opposition leader Mariano Rajoy; almost the same figure as for Zapatero.

This historic level of disaffection with Spain's political class has been a major factor in the continued city square occupations. These have now spread out into local neighbourhoods and are confronting eviction attempts by police.

Disaffection with Spanish democracy also may help explain one of the biggest upsets in the municipal elections on Sunday: the pro-independence coalition Bildu in the Basque country picked up more council seats than any other party in that territory. This leftwing party, which the Spanish right has described as "pro-terrorist" but has openly condemned violence, was very nearly prevented from standing by the supreme court at the request of the government. It is a great irony that the biggest victor in the elections was the only political option previously deemed unsuitable for Spanish democracy.

The PSOE has lost great popularity, which reached a peak after it removed Spanish troops from Iraq in 2004 ¨C by adopting a far-reaching austerity programme. Previously, Zapatero repeatedly promised he would "not make workers pay for the crisis".

Yet since the elections there have been two responses by the PSOE that suggest it will stay on its new course. Firstly, it has announced it shall not modify its economic programme, which includes labour "reforms" against "absenteeism" and on union bargaining rights.

It is hoped that by the general elections such measures will have helped resuscitate collapsed investment. However, similar gambles by the Greek and Irish governments have not worked. Instead, reduced public spending has depressed private demand and larger crises have ensued. Such a panorama is unlikely to weaken the current protest by the "no future" generation and may encourage more.

A second issue is that of Zapatero's likely successor. After the PSOE's worst election result under democracy, regional "barons" (presidents) successfully managed to dissuade Carme Chac¨®n, the young defence minister, from standing for prime minister in primaries. They did so by threatening an emergency congress in which less PSOE members would directly vote.

Most commentators agree that this leaves the door wide open to the man who already arguably wields the most governmental power, Alfredo P¨¦rez Rubalcaba. Since last autumn he has been deputy prime minister, interior minister and government spokesman.

General consensus has it that Rubalcaba, an ex-university lecturer, is highly intelligent. A sign of this was when he stepped into ministry of labour discussions with the unions when an agreement on pensions was stalling. Union leaders had held a general strike in September against legal changes facilitating dismissals of an already precarious workforce. So Rubalcaba suggested a limited tempering of the changes in exchange for the unions accepting an increase in the retirement age to 67 years. The union leaders accepted, much to the outrage of the population, 79% of whom rejected the increase.

Arguably, Rubalcaba's ability as a self-defined "strategist" is matched by his authoritarianism. Not only was he responsible for the attempt to ban Bildu, but was also a key player in the controversial militarisation of the airports during a labour dispute before Christmas. In this conflict, air-traffic controllers were forced to land planes in front of armed soldiers. Since then, strikers have been sacked and threatened with long-term prison sentences.

When once asked to describe himself, Rubalcaba quoted a literary detective: "If I were not bad, I would be dead, and if I were not sweet, I could not live" ¨C an intriguing answer but one which acknowledges a dark side.

If Rubalcaba does take over, it is hard to imagine a new convergence between government and the street. Instead, the political crisis of recent weeks may just be the beginning.









A suicide bomber attacked a provincial governor's compound in Afghanistan, killing two German soldiers and at least four Afghans, as well as injuring Germany's top military commander in the country.

The attack in the north of the country on Saturday came a day after two British soldiers were killed in a bomb blast while on patrol in southern Helmand province amid a rise in roadside bomb and suicide attacks as part of a Taliban spring offensive.

The British soliders from 42 Commando Royal Marines were killed by an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Nad-e Ali district of Helmand province on Friday, the Ministry of Defence said. Their deaths take to 368 the number of British military personnel who have died since operations in Afghanistan began in 2001.

A spokesman from the MoD said the two marines had been on patrol "disrupting insurgent activity" in the Loy Mandeh area when they were killed.

In the north, the explosion in Takhar province on Saturday took place as officials were meeting in the governor's office complex, according to Lal Mohammad Ahmadzai, a regional spokesman for the Afghan national police, who was attending the meeting when the blast occurred.

The German military told Der Spiegel's online magazine that two German soldiers were killed and that General Markus Kneip, Nato's commander for northern Afghanistan, was wounded along with three of his soldiers.

A Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, said the attack was part of the insurgency's campaign against high-ranking government officials.

Among those killed was General Daood Daood, a former interior minister who was police commander in northern Afghanistan, said Dr Hassain Basech, health director of the province.

The others who died were the provincial police chief General Shah Jahan Noori, a secretary to the governor, and one of Daood's bodyguards, the health director said.

He said that 10 Afghans were wounded, including governor Abdul Jabar Taqwa, a cameraman working in the governor's office, and eight members of the Afghan national security forces. A number of Nato troops were also wounded, he said, but he could not provide details.

Violence has been on the rise in the north of Afghanistan, where there are known hideouts for the Taliban, al-Qaida and fighters from other militant factions. Nato has sent more troops to the north and has been pushing harder into militant-held areas.

Ratko Mladic delivered a tirade of abuse against officials involved in his capture when he was first brought to court, the Observer has learned. He accused them of "working for the CIA" and later remarked chillingly to one prominent official that he could have had him killed on two occasions.

Mladic, who has refused to recognise the authority of the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague, where he is expected to be extradited to this week on charges of genocide, also denied being a killer, adding that all Serbs bore a shared guilt for voting for President Slobodan Milosevic, architect of the Balkan wars.

How Mladic has behaved since being brought to a Belgrade court was disclosed in the most detailed account yet of the state of mind of the man charged with orchestrating the Srebrenica massacre and the siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war.

It came as a source close to Serbia's intelligence service, the BIA ¨C or Security Information Agency ¨C said Mladic had been living openly, although "not continuously", in the village of Lazarevo, where he was found, for several years. A BIA team observing the house of Branko Mladic, where Ratko Mladic was found, in one of two addresses he had been using in the area, had watched him going about "everyday activities" including helping his cousin Branko on the farm and attending village celebrations. "Personally speaking," said the source, "I think some officials knew where he was living. It was peculiar, too, that when the house was raided that there were no personal possessions there."

Mladic's behaviour since capture was described by Bruno Vekaric, a deputy prosecutor at the War Crimes Prosecutor's Office, who has met Mladic twice since his arrest in Lazarevo on Thursday. "He was really angry at first. He recognised me from television and said: 'You're in the CIA!' He knew my name and asked me: 'Are you a Serb?' You know, because it is not a common Serbian name. I told him my father was from Dubrovnik [in Croatia]. He felt like a great Serb and was angry at the way he was being treated on that first day."

Vekaric added that examination of Mladic by court-appointed medical experts confirmed that he had suffered at least two minor strokes, perhaps more, but was coherent and fit to stand trial. That was confirmed by his wife, Bosiljka, speaking after visiting Mladic, who said he had suffered a stroke in 2008.

"He was stubborn and resistant. He did not want to co-operate with the judge at all on the first day," said Vekaric. "He spoke about his career. And what was interesting ¨C on that first day ¨C was that he said to me: 'Bruno, I am not a killer. But the people who killed, they should be held responsible'."

Vekaric gave his account in his court office above the cells where Mladic is being held in a block on his own, watched 24 hours by two guards through an open door. He described a vivid psychological profile of the man who spent 16 years on the run. "He's always observed," said Vekaric, "but he's told the guards: 'You don't have to worry. I'm not going to commit suicide'."

Mladic emerges from the account as a man who has a desperate need to explain himself. "He needs to speak. To communicate," said Vekaric. "He was alone for so long he needs to speak."

Although they had never met before, Mladic made clear to Vekaric that he had followed his statements over the years on television. "The first day he was very tired. He was stressed and aggressive. The second time I saw him in court he apologised to me for his outburst."

What has been visible since then is a more familiar Mladic, arrogant and demanding, insisting not only on his own innocence but on the shared guilt of all of the Serbian people. "He said: 'You elected [Slobodan] Milosevic, not me. You are all guilty, not me'."

During his time in court, speaking to officials on the margins of the proceedings to extradite him to The Hague for trial, some details have emerged of how Mladic has lived. He has had no mobile phone ¨C not trusting it or the internet. The television channels that he watched were local Serbian ones, describing cable television as "fed by the CIA".

Mladic has delivered recriminations, too, over how his family has been treated during the long manhunt. "He asked for his pension [cut off in 2004] to be reinstated. He said: 'You destroyed everything. Because of you my daughter-in-law lost her job. They destroyed the financial connections of my son Darko'," Vekaric said. He added that as well as asking for strawberries and a television, which has been delivered to his cell, Mladic had asked to visit the grave of his daughter, Anna, who committed suicide in 1994, and had also asked if he could see his grandchildren.

Vekaric added that Mladic had suffered increasingly straitened circumstances since 2006 ¨C when he narrowly evaded arrest in the village of Ljuba. This was as a result of the targeting of those in his support network, including financiers, and increased supervision of family members, who had been followed closely by the BIA. "He only had relatives who could look after him," said the source familiar with the BIA operation to capture him. "None of his close family visited him in Lazarevo while the house was being observed. They were being watched too closely."

"When you see him," said Vekaric, "you see a man who was not looked after himself well in the last three to four years. He looks like someone who has not had proper medical attention in a long time."








Within 20 years of the liberation of the Dachau concentration camp by the British army, the Beatles were playing in Hamburg. This was in part the achievement of the Beatles, of course, but it was also Germany's. The country had undergone the painful and difficult process of reckoning in order to become the heart of democratic Europe.

Next year will be the 20th anniversary of the closure of the concentration camps in Bosnia and the beginning of the three-year hurricane of violence unleashed across that stillborn country by General Ratko Mladic and his peers, until the Srebrenica massacre in 1995 ¨C the worst wartime atrocity on European soil since 1945.

Of course there is no analogy between the two events, but the former director of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington DC, Walter Reich, helped me with the terminology at the time when he said that the ravages in Bosnia were "echoes, loud and clear" of the catastrophe his institution was charged to commemorate.

There is inevitable relief and even a sense of triumph that Mladic will soon ¨C pending the predictable whingeing about his health ¨C be on his way to The Hague. But there is also something sick and hollow in this moment, which comes a decade after Mladic's master, former Serbian president Slobodan Milosevic, undertook the same itinerary.

Hollow, partly because it took so long: the Serbian state was ostensibly hunting this man while he enjoyed a military salary and pension. I spent a drunken night in Belgrade not long ago with Mladic's lunatic entourage ¨C men who had been arrested for sheltering him and who made it very clear they were in communication with their mentor.

And hollow also because the international failure to capture Mladic all that time echoed at worst the collaboration and at best the appeasement of the diplomatic community with his murderous mission. We who endeavoured to report the carnage in Bosnia did so for three long, bloody years while the international community deemed the carnage acceptable, in a way. Three years during which the same diplomatic apparatus now eager to brand Mladic and Radovan Karadzic war criminals clasped their hands in yet another grotesque "peace initiative".

One of the telling episodes in the history of the massacre of 8,000 men and boys from the UN-protected "safe area" of Srebrenica was a lunch of suckling lamb two days before the killing began at which Mladic entertained the commander of the UN Protection Force, General Bernard Janvier. It was a moment that encapsulated the three years of appeasement by all those diplomats and military men, many of them British, who regarded and treated Mladic as an equal. If their hubris abates for a moment, they know who they are.

But the main reason for the nerve-grating comfortlessness in Mladic's capture is that there has been no real reckoning among the Bosnian Serbs ¨C and very little in Serbia proper ¨C of the kind the Germans underwent. The EU may deem that sufficient movement towards amends has been made to warrant negotiations for Serbian entry into its family of nations, but on the ground nothing has actually occurred.

The north-west of Bosnia and the Drina Valley in which the worst atrocities occurred remain cesspools of the hatred that led to the slaughter; a crazed, nonsensical mixture of justification and denial which suggests that, given a fair wind, the communities for whom Mladic is a hero would do it all again.

In less well-known towns in eastern Bosnia, such as Visegrad and Foca, where thousands of Muslims were murdered, packed into houses and incinerated alive, raped or forcibly evicted, there are monuments ¨C but they are erected to the handful of fallen Serbs from those places who died on the front. A woman who returned to place a plaque to commemorate the rape and murder of women in Foca was attacked and her little monument smashed.

On the day that we entered the Omarska concentration camp in 1992, it was described by the president of the Bosnian Serb "crisis staff" that managed it ¨C Milomir Stakic, currently serving 40 years after his conviction at The Hague ¨C as "a collection centre, not a camp". Earlier this month, a group of survivors of the camp wanted to go on to the site, now an iron ore mine, to commemorate the dead; the local authority in the presiding town of Prijedor objected, insisting that Omarska had been no more than "a collection centre". The same revolting term, two decades on.

There is no memorial to the hundreds, possibly thousands, of Muslims and Catholic Croats who perished in Omarska ¨C a site mined and 51% owned by Britain's richest "non-dom", the steel magnate Lakshmi Mittal ¨C although their scattered skeletons and remains continue to be excavated all around the mine. There is a memorial at the entrance to the other concentration camp we penetrated that day in 1992, Trnopolje. It is erected to the memory not of those who died there, but of the few fallen Serbs of the village.

Prijedor is covered with similar monuments to the perpetrators' cult of victimhood, while in the surrounding towns and villages executioners, mass killers, camp guards and torturers go about their business as police officers, postmen, whatever ¨C as they do in Srebrenica and neighbouring Bratunac, where the massacre was planned.

There is, however, a memorial near Srebrenica ¨C on the insistence of the international community that facilitated the massacre. When the widowed and fatherless women made initial journeys to it, and the graves of their dead, they faced baying Bosnian Serb crowds brandishing the portrait of Ratko Mladic. The same portrait adorns bars, cafes and souvenir stalls all over Serbia and the Bosnian "entity" they call "Republika Srpska".

The international community, led by the late Richard Holbrooke, rewarded the Serbs for their three years of carnage by establishing this entity, the "RS", cravenly agreed to by Bosnia's Muslim president and that of Croatia, in order to partition the country and enforce "peace" a few months after Srebrenica. Holbrooke had personally stopped the Bosnian troops from liberating their ravaged territory just as the war was finally turning in their favour ¨C these are facts little-spoken in the aftermath, the institutionalisation of the west's failure.

The Republika Srpska makes no secret of its desire to accede to Serbia proper, or to make Bosnia such a dysfunctional state that it becomes pointless beyond the heart-stopping beauty and delightful warmth and humour of its people. Postage stamps sold in the capital, Sarajevo, are not valid in the RS; railway engines have to be swapped as a train from Ploce to Zagreb crosses the country, from Croatian, to Bosnian, to Serbian and back to Croatian again (and these countries want to join the EU?). After two decades, a planned motorway linking the country's two main cities ¨C Sarajevo and the Bosnian Serb capital of Banja Luka ¨C is still unbuilt.

Oddly, the only international organisations to sanction Bosnia for the weirdness of this partition are Fifa and Uefa, which dealt football fans the crushing blow of demanding that the game be run by a single national authority before the country or its clubs could compete internationally ¨C something the RS is determined not to concede.

The various strata of the well-paid international presence in Bosnia preach "reconciliation". The arrest of Mladic will be seen as part of the process, and in some ways rightly. Better he be tried than not. "Move on," victims are always told, sometimes even to "forgive and forget". Bosnia, they hear, is now at peace. The war criminals are delivered for trial.

Recently, for a book, I have begun touring Europe and America to speak to those scattered folk who have survived or been bereaved by Mladic's violence, dealing not only with their ghosts and demons, losses and memories, but with the fact that no Serb they have ever met has admitted, let alone apologised, for what was done ¨C quite the reverse, in fact. No reckoning. No equivalent of the Beatles in Hamburg, let alone the Jewish Museum in Berlin.

"Reckoning" is one of the harshest words in the English language. It means coming to terms with what was done in the wake of calamity, staring at oneself in the mirror, and making amends, historical, political and material. The delivery of Mladic for trial is an important moment, but for justice rather than reckoning. The substance of reckoning is on the ground and among the people who gladly carried out Mladic's heinous orders. There, it is not happening. And without reckoning, there can be no reconciliation, and thereby no real peace.











Wearing an elegant silk jacket, carrying a white Dolce & Gabbana handbag and sporting her customary silver eye shadow, the beleaguered mayor of Milan, Letizia Moratti, cut an incongruous figure as she scrunched across the gravel at an old Gypsy campsite in Milan last week.

The 1,500 Gypsies who once lived here have long gone, which is why Moratti had brought the TV crews with her. "When I first came here, I saw an undignified way of life. Now there are zero Gypsies," she said, before listing the other Gypsy settlements around Milan that she plans to shut down if re-elected this weekend.

Moratti's tough talk matched her mayoral campaign, which has been the most vicious and xenophobic in living memory. This is Silvio Berlusconi's city, the place where he made his fortune and established his power base. The left has not had a look-in here for two decades, but now Moratti, who represents Berlusconi's Freedom People party, is in trouble ¨C partly because of Berlusconi's "bunga-bunga" party-related scandals ¨C and the politics of Milan have turned extremely nasty.

Insults flew and there was brawling on the city's streets after Moratti's opponent, Giuliano Pisapia, a lawyer and former communist MP, beat her by 40,000 votes in the first ballot two weeks ago. As the run-off vote takes place and there is a feeling that the unthinkable could happen: Berlusconi could lose control of Milan.

"It is hard to beat the vulgarity and violence of Italian politics today, but this campaign has excelled," said Gian Antonio Stella, a columnist at Corriere della Sera.

Berlusconi has made the job of holding Milan a personal challenge as he confronts plummeting polls and whispers within his coalition that he has lost his populist appeal. Should Milan fall, fearful supporters whisper, Berlusconi may not be far behind.

"If Pisapia wins, Milan will became a Muslim town, a Gypsyville of Roma camps, a city besieged by foreigners," Berlusconi has warned in one of a series of increasingly irate video messages on his website. He told one TV interviewer that anyone voting for the centre-left had "left their brains at home". Meanwhile, young activists brought in from throughout Italy fanned out across Milan telling locals Pisapia would open "injection rooms" for drug addicts.

"If Pisapia wins, there will be a boom in rapes and prostitutes on the streets," said Massimo Corsaro, a Freedom People MP.

A hardworking city that generates 3.1% of Italy's gross domestic product, Milan gave Berlusconi his first break as a property developer and he later built his TV empire, Mediaset, there. It was the prospect of a former communist taking Milan from him that drove Berlusconi to hijack Moratti's campaign, showing up at her rallies to make wild promises about tripling financial assistance to the elderly.

Currently facing four trials in Milan, including the Rubygate trial, where he is accused of paying a Moroccan teenager for sex, Berlusconi also sought to win votes by insulting the judges from the court steps, referring to them as "a cancer". Last week a clearly embarrassed Barack Obama was lectured by Berlusconi on the persecution that he believes he faces when they met at the G8 summit in Deauville.

"Berlusconi is locked in his bunker and has lost all contact with reality," said Antonio di Pietro, leader of the opposition Italy of Values party.

"He hoped to win votes by showing up for his trials, but few people showed up to cheer him and it turned off the moderate voters here," said supermarket clerk Roberto Paternoster, 25.

Moratti made her own mistakes, accusing Pisapia in a TV debate on the eve of the first round of voting of hiding an old conviction for car theft, when in fact he had been acquitted. Hours later, Pisapia had taken 48% of the Milan vote to Moratti's 41.6%.

"Berlusconi's big mistake was to think Milan would be frightened by a middle-class leftwinger like Pisapia," said Stella.

Ignoring calls from his own party to lower the tone ahead of the run-off, Berlusconi gave speeches on five TV stations in one day, prompting Italy's TV watchdog to dish out fines totalling €800,000 (¡ê693,000) for violations of fair airtime rules before elections.

Back in Milan, an incredulous Pisapia alleged that someone was placing fake Gypsies in street markets to hand out leaflets bearing his name, and fake workmen were knocking on doors to tell locals that a huge mosque was about to be built on their doorstep.

Il Giornale, the Berlusconi family-owned newspaper, which has stoked the poisonous atmosphere by attacking bishops who dared to criticise the xenophobic mood, claimed that Pisapia's accusations were unfounded. "Even his magistrate friends won't believe this," one editorial suggested.

Various Berlusconi allies have joined the fray. "I live and breathe this city and Milan does not want to become a Gypsy town," said Daniela Santanch¨¨, the fiery minister who founded the Movement for Italy. She was backed by Giuseppe Cali, 23, one of the Freedom People activists in Milan's Piazza Duomo on Thursday night for a Moratti rally and concert. "If I go into a park with my girlfriend, I just don't feel safe if there are groups of foreigners there," he said.

"Many Milanese have moved out of town, and we now have half a million pensioners cheek by jowl with 200,000 immigrants," said Ettore Albertoni, a former regional governor with the Northern League, the devolutionist party on which Berlusconi depends for support in parliament.

But the League is tiring of Berlusconi's numerous scandals and fears that the media magnate's ranting at judges may be alienating voters. Umberto Bossi, the rough-spoken leader of the League, has failed to show up at several rallies where he was due to share the stage with Moratti.

"Milan is so important for Berlusconi because it is where the alliance with the Northern League was forged," said Tito Boeri, an economist at Milan's Bocconi university. "If he loses Milan, the alliance may collapse."

There was further angst for the Moratti camp when, at the last minute, star act Gigi D'Alessio pulled out of a concert in support of the mayor, claiming that he had been insulted by Northern League representatives because he hails from Naples in the south of Italy. The job of entertaining Berlusconi's flag-waving activists fell, bizarrely, to Bryan Ferry, who gamely performed a medley of hits.

Hardly noticed by the press, Pisapia is out on the stump every day. Last week he spent a hot Thursday afternoon giving an off-the-cuff speech to 400 residents in a park in the working-class Quartiere 8 neighbourhood on the edge of Milan. As children milled around and a jazz band played, Pisapia showed little grasp of skilful oratory, but drew applause as he talked up plans to open new markets to bring communities back together. "You see, Milan the city is more tolerant than Letizia Moratti," said Nino, a taxi driver and Pisapia supporter.

An hour after the Democratic Party (PD) candidate left, the event was still going strong as free plates of fava beans and wine in plastic cups were handed out. "You don't see a party atmosphere like this often in Milan," said student Jacopo Ceccerelli, 23, who pointed out that in a primary held to find a candidate to represent the opposition, Pisapia had beaten the PD's chosen man. "People here think he is their candidate, not someone handpicked by party officials in Rome."

If Pisapia does win, it will be one of the shock results of recent political history in Italy. Stella believes that, against the odds and after an extraordinarily vitriolic campaign, it could happen. "Everything tends to start in Milan, from the Risorgimento, to socialism, fascism and the 'clean hands' investigations into corruption," he said. "Silvio Berlusconi was born here too, and it is possible his era will end here."










This land is our land: pipeline protesters Willie and Mary Corduff at the quay at Rossport. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod for the Observer
If the sea is calm, you can hear the traffic in New York," goes the local introduction to the breathtaking beauty of Erris, in the north of County Mayo, where the coastline winds its way through little coves and beneath the cliffs of the wild seaboard at Europe's edge. Most nights, though, Manhattan must be quiet, for the only audible sounds are the distant baying of a dog several miles away, the soft bleating of newborn lambs from lush coastal meadows and the sighing of the brine as it moves across rocks and shingle.

Soon, however, this deep peace will be shattered forever. "And this is where it all began," says Willie Corduff, standing in his farmyard atop fields that tumble down to the estuary of Sruwaddacon. Corduff's family have farmed here for generations. "It's been hard," he says, "but we've made a living doing a little bit of everything, you know ¨C a little suckling, a little silage, a little hay." Now that way of life stands to be destroyed, along with that of Corduff's neighbours, who fish the Atlantic waters as their forefathers have for centuries. Right across the estuary from Corduff's farm, where meadows and bog once came down to the sands, diggers now chug and churn the earth and security men strut behind the reinforced fencing in fluorescent "hi-viz" jackets. After dusk has fallen, what was once the pure darkness of night is pierced by floodlights. A mile behind this "exempted development" that needs no planning permission, a refinery has been built, heavily guarded, a gash across the land inflicted by lights, concrete, fencing and those ubiquitous fluorescent jackets. The Shell oil company has come to Erris ¨C and how.

"It was a Scottish fellow came one morning," says Corduff. "And you know, it was the arrogance that triggered me off. There was no asking. He told me what was going to happen, taking me for a fool."

In 1996, a reserve of gas had been found 50 miles offshore by a consortium called Enterprise Energy Ireland and a major stake was bought by Shell in 2002. The plan has been to bring raw, untreated gas ashore by pipe, to the refinery at Ballinaboy, six miles south of the estuary. The pipe is to come ashore at Broadhaven Bay's widest and loveliest point, and was to skirt the estuary's northern shore, through farmland. "There's miles of empty bog out there," says John Monaghan, one of the leaders of the ensuing protest, "and they chose to take it across the farms. Where there are farms there are farmhouses, and where there are farmhouses there are families."

The arguments were made: successive government ministers insisted that what became known as the Corrib gas project would decrease Irish dependency on imported Scottish gas and provide up to 60% of Ireland's needs at peak periods. On the other side, there were immediate environmental concerns: Broadhaven Bay and nearby Carrowmore Lake are EU-designated Special Protection Areas; the lake, near the refinery, provides drinking water. There were concerns about potential explosions and the initial high pressure (345 bar) at which the gas would be piped ashore, and the fact that, as raw gas, it contained impurities, and would be corrosive. And there were issues of history and community.

Maura Harrington, a retired teacher in the village of Inver, who is one of the protest's most outspoken voices, says: "This is about a sense of place and its people. We may not qualify as indigenous people, but we have our land and culture, to which we belong. All those people who emigrated from Erris through history, Erris never left them. They say we are opposed to progress, and laugh at us. But to me, progress is the ability to sustain yourself, and those who come after you. It's nature and nurture: what we here call muinhin, which means of the place, and cointeann, which means to get a little awkward when that place and its people are about to be torn apart."

There had been a choice in Ireland about what to do with the "new frontier" ¨C abundant natural gas off its western shores. There were two models: that of the Norwegians, who guaranteed a state-owned stake in exploitation and quota for domestic consumption, and that of British North Sea gas, where profits were largely spirited away by multinational companies. The Norwegian model was favoured by the Irish minister for industry and commerce during the 1970s, Justin Keating, who judged that Britain was wasting resources while Norway was securing its future. But the tide turned, as Keating's notions of state responsibility were swept aside by enthusiasm for the free market and Margaret Thatcher's handling of North Sea gas.

In 2000, Enterprise began digging holes for the pipeline through farmland in Rossport, and was granted planning permission by Mayo County Council for the refinery at Ballinaboy. The following year the Irish government awarded itself the right to statutorily acquire the private land it needed ¨C the first consent orders issued by former minister Frank Fahey on election day in May 2002.

Enterprise, and later Shell, had courted Irish politicians ¨C and the affair was reciprocated, with entertainment for oil executives in Fianna F¨¢il tents at Galway races ¨C but everyone in the loop was dealt a blow when County Mayo's permission for the terminal was appealed to the national planning board, Bord Plean¨¢la. The planning inspector, Kevin Moore, recommended refusal, concluding that: "From a strategic planning perspective, this is the wrong site. From the perspective of government policy which seeks to foster balanced regional development, this is the wrong site. From the perspective of minimising environmental impact, this is the wrong site; and consequently: from the perspective of sustainable development this is the wrong site."

Enterprise Oil was taken over by Shell soon after, and the minutes of a meeting of the company's managing directors laid out a plan for how to deal with Moore's objections. "The Committee", read the minutes, "queried whether the Group had sufficiently well-placed contacts with the Irish government and regulators" and "undertook to explore this issue further". In December 2003, Shell went back to Mayo Council and residents again appealed to the Bord Plean¨¢la. This time a new director approved the plan.

Farmers across whose land the pipe was due to run were offered compensation. Some took it, but six owners of smallholdings along the route refused ¨C one of them was Willie Corduff. In response, the Irish government passed, in 2005, the first ever legislation allowing a private corporation the same rights of compulsory purchase afforded to a state agency. Still Corduff and his fellow small farmers refused to admit Shell on to their land. "I think they thought they could break our spirit," he says. "I don't think they realised what kind of people they were dealing with. I think they thought we were farmers with 2,000 acres driving Jeeps, not people struggling on a little bit of bog, making it greener by the yard with a shovel." Corduff keeps his cloth cap on as we retreat to the kitchen of his farmhouse, where he explains how he became one of the first of many to go to jail.

In April 2005, Shell secured interlocutory orders against those refusing to let company agents on to their land. On 29 June, five people, including Corduff, were arrested and tried for contempt of the order, and jailed for 94 days. "When the judge said I was going to jail," says Corduff, "what little bit of hair that's upon my head was sticking up on end."

Corduff and his colleagues became known as the "Rossport Five", and the case of Shell's Corrib pipeline became a cause c¨¦l¨¨bre across Ireland. Now, the story of the uprising that followed has been made into a film, The Pipe, which is picking up worldwide awards, with queues around the block to watch screenings in Bucharest, Phoenix, Boston, San Francisco and New York ¨C as well as Galway and London.

The director is Risteard O'Domhnaill, just past 30 years old, who at first covered the dispute as a news cameraman for the Irish-language television service and whose uncle farms sheep and cattle between Inver and the Erris coastline. He was appalled by the way in which many of his peers reported the story: "There was a culture of 'don't rock the boat' ¨C the media had got caught up in the Celtic Tiger business, ready to round on anyone who criticised development, or deregulation ¨C in this case, anyone who questioned what was happening to my uncle's community."

The Pipe, says O'Domhnaill, "is Local Hero gone wrong" ¨C it is also a vivid, close-range narrative of a battle unfolding, and a cruel parable of our times.

"People talk about us as though we want to be going back to the Stone Age," says Corduff. "But those people who farmed here with a donkey and cart and a bucket, they handed it on to their children. If this thing goes ahead, we won't be able to do that. They say we're standing in the way of progress, but what is it we're standing in the way of? We're standing in the way of the place being polluted and destroyed by Shell, that's what. They say we're enjoying ourselves with this protest. But we're not ¨C it's a terrible sadness, the whole thing."

The imprisonment of the Rossport Five and nationwide demonstrations in support of them led to the formation of Shell To Sea. One of the most prominent figures in the protest alliance is Maura Harrington, who spent a month in jail for slapping a police officer in the face. On another occasion, she says: "I refused to pay a fine, went to jail for 13 days and saved myself ¡è2,700." When a first attempt was made to lay the pipe at sea, Harrington went on hunger strike for 10 days.

"My mother was one of the few women for the time to have gone to the University of Galway, and my father was a trade union man, so he'd have been politically aware," she says, by way of introduction over a pub dinner in the homely Western Strands Hotel near Belmullet. "So I'd have been brought up this way¡­ But in the end the cause of Shell To Sea is brutally simple: to oppose an assault on the air, the land, the sea and its people ¨C and on the nation of Ireland. Shell tries to obfuscate things with environmental-impact statements and spin, but in the end it comes to this: will the traitors who govern this country allow such an assault to succeed, or will we stop it? Will raw gas come ashore to be refined and sold abroad to enrich a multinational corporation, or will it not? In a world of spin and virtuality, this is all very real ¨C I don't want to sound all Marie Antoinette, but when you are living close to the land, air and sea, you are living in the real world."

Not everyone in the community opposed the project, as Shell and the Irish government point out. Father Kevin Hegarty of the neighbouring parish of Kilmore draws on a line from The Playboy of the Western World ¨C set in these parts ¨C to describe O'Domhnaill's film: "'It's a great story and he tells it lovely, but he doesn't tell the whole story. I'd say the majority of this community supports the project. It's a way to provide employment and an opening towards the development of sustainable fuels in Ireland." (Father Kevin's colleague Fr Michael Nallen, in Kilcommon itself, opposed the pipeline.)

There is argument over how many jobs the project would create: a spokeswoman for Shell, Denise Horan, says 450 people are currently employed, with "several hundred" more jobs to come with the building of the pipeline. "When the project is in operation, there will be approximately 130 full-time jobs," she says. There is also some debate as to how much the gas will benefit Ireland. Ms Horan says: "All the gas from the Corrib field will be consumed in Ireland," and that gas cannot be exported to the UK because the pipe runs one way; but O'Domhnaill insists that "there's no compulsion on them to serve Irish interests; in the end, they can sell it wherever they like, at whatever price they like ¨C that's how it is with the multinational oil companies."

In June 2008, the Irish government gave Shell permission to begin laying its pipeline at sea and the biggest pipe-laying vessel in the world, the Solitaire, arrived to do so. The challenge to this colossus by a fisherman named Pat O'Donnell, his family and supporters, bobbing about on the ocean with the bows of the Solitaire towering above, makes for the most compelling and heart-breaking passage in O'Domhnaill's film.

The fishermen's battle against Shell begins heart-warmingly with O'Donnell saying to the camera: "Isn't it a lovely sight when you see all the fishermen together and fighting for the one thing?" But soon, it becomes a battle that turns fisherman against fisherman, as Shell offers money to those prepared to relinquish their fishing rights.

The scene climaxes with a remarkable piece of real-life action cinema as O'Donnell ¨C in his little fishing boat, the John Michelle ¨C and two other ships confront the immense Solitaire bow to bow. "I've a right to fish here," says O'Donnell of his lobster pots, but warships of the Irish navy arrive to ensure the Solitaire's way.

They call O'Donnell "The Chief" for miles around the lovely hamlet of Porturlin where he lives, and it is quite an honour to clamber aboard the John Michelle with him. "If I lived to be 100, I'd never sell this boat," says the Chief. "This is history, this boat.

"I was born in 1957," says Pat, "second youngest of 11 children. All my sisters emigrated to the United States at a young age, but we five boys stayed behind to fish, for the sea has been good to our family. I tried a while in London, in construction, but had to come back ¨C I missed the sea; I'd known at a young age what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, and my oldest, Jonathan, was skipper of his own boat aged 15 ¨C he's 26 now."

He continues: "I'd be a fella who loved a quiet life," but that aspiration ended after the fishermen's group he initially mobilised against Shell commissioned a scientist at Southampton University, Dr Alex Rogers, to survey the impact the pipeline would have on their livelihoods, the stocks at sea. Dr Rogers concluded pessimistically, and, says O'Donnell, "after all I'd read about Shell in Nigeria, who'd want them here as well?" He joined the protest movement blockading the contract workers' access to the refinery site.

"'People have the right to go to work,' we kept being told, but Pat O'Donnell and his son, who have the right to fish at sea under a ministerial licence were arrested for setting their pots," he fumes. "I'd never think I'd see the day when the Irish navy would turn its guns on Irish citizens fishing Irish waters, for the sake of a British and Dutch company."

O'Donnell served two jail sentences totalling seven months, only to watch most of the other members of his protest flotilla take Shell's silver, one by one. "One of them turned his boat into a portable toilet for men working on the jack-up rigs. How low can you get? What a way for a good fishing boat to be ending up, shifting shit for Shell!"

On 11 June 2009, O'Donnell claims his other boat, Iona Isle, was boarded off the western tip of Broadhaven Bay by "four masked men with guns, who went down below. All I could see was their eyes and their mouths. They came up some minutes later, vanished and I noticed the boat was water-heavy. I put out a Mayday call and had 20 minutes to get into my life craft. I wasn't right for a good while after, for it's a terrible thing for a fisherman to lose his boat in such an attack. I tried to get insurance, but the broker told me I wasn't covered for acts of terrorism." The police and the IRMS security firm contracted by Shell have both denied involvement in the sinking of the boat. Barrister Brian Barrington investigated the incident and that said as the boat was sunk at sea it was impossible to verify the claim.

On the shoreline at Glengad, above Broadhaven Bay's widest sweep, is the spot where the pipe hits landfall. Above this wild, wondrous foreshore is a standing stone circle. "It goes back to the first farmers on this land, and beyond," says O'Domhnaill as we clamber up the hill for a better view of the ocean sweep. This is where the pipe will come ashore, after which it will run overland beside the stone circle, beneath the estuary to Rossport, and journey overland to the refinery. It is here that Shell has been obliged to reduce the high pressure at which the gas will come ashore, but those who live here remain exposed to what they believe ¨C despite Shell's assurances to the contrary ¨C is the weakest joint, and most potentially dangerous point, in the process.

Above the site and just below the stone circle is the home of John Monaghan, who formed a group that split from Shell To Sea's absolute opposition, supporting instead a compromise route, proposed by local priests, across open, uninhabited bog at Glinsk, to the north. Its name was Pobal Chill Chom¨¢in, People of Kilcommon. The rift is plain to see in O'Domhnaill's movie: the sad, inevitable, bad-tempered rupture of the vulnerable ¨C neighbour pitched against neighbour ¨C when faced by the giant.

Monaghan grew up in Nottingham, but "came back in the 1980s, to the family roots. And it's changed even since then. When I came back, they were still bringing in turf by horse and cart. Now, the Celtic Tiger has come and gone, and attitudes have changed ¨C more selfishness, boom or bust. Bust, as it turned out. Shell is riding the tiger's back, the idea that greed is good, all development is good, end of story, no questions asked."

Corrib, says Monaghan, "is an entirely new approach ¨C the 'sub-sea tie-back' system that brings in dirty gas and refines it ashore. And the idea of compulsory purchase orders by the private sector is also totally new. Also, I wonder if they've figured a worst-case scenario into their risk-assessment calculations, as I'd always do as a civil engineer. I was open to the idea at first, but we never got a glimpse of the reality. There's been zero accountability."

O'Domhnaill's film, as it reaches critical mass, becomes a vortex of images of how the pipeline's route has been forged: police officers and security men confronting protesters and their sympathisers at every turn.

"We keep being told 'the law must be upheld,'" says Monaghan. "But whose law? Shell's law. It might be called the law, but it's not justice. There is no way we can get justice. Even if there's a judicial review, we're liable for costs if we lose, and they'd break us. The law is that whoever has the money gets their way. Look at them! Navy warships patrolling, people coming up the beach from inflatables, moving through the village with video cameras filming us, police officers beating people up, Jeeps roaring around with number plates removed and no tax discs. And that's the law? If there's one thing I've learned from all this, it's that justice and the law are mutually exclusive."

"The Garda?" Corduff asks. "We put trust in them, used to have craic with them, our kids used to stay over at theirs. Now, if the children see a squad car or a paddy wagon, they'll be running off into the bog. That's a sad thing."

The fenced-in work beneath Monaghan's house is another "exempted development" without planning permission ¨C which Shell argues is unnecessary anyway, as the pipe follows a route authorised at ministerial level. Even so, disruption to the family of Colm Henry, a few fields along from Monaghan, has been, he says, vulgar and extreme.

Henry is a soft-spoken man who plays country music in a band which tours Ireland and the UK. His walls are hung with Native American artefacts he brought back from visits to Arizona. "It's the most unspoilt stretch on the west coast," says his gracious wife Gabrielle, peeling potatoes. "There aren't even many tourists, and when they do find it, we ask them: 'Please don't tell anyone.'" "We used to go about our business in peace ¨C we were left alone," says Henry, "and we would be using the beach in all weathers, swimming in summer and walking in winter."

When Shell's security dispatch invaded Glengad, they did so "with van loads of men", recalls Henry. "All night long there were heavy-duty lights directed at our home ¨C even with the curtains drawn the house was illuminated. You had 50 cars and vans outside, floodlights and a cameraman sitting on the mound filming us in our house and on our own land."

The worst intrusions came, says Henry, "when they started filming the children walking on their own family land. My grandchildren went to play on the beach; they'd be changing to swim, when the security would be photographing them. Now I think that if I was to be filming children undressing on a beach, I might be ending up on the front page of a tabloid newspaper. But no ¨C they can do what they wish, with impunity. Going around in balaclavas, no ID, they even have gloved hands, Jesus you can't even tell the colour of their skin ¨C and they're very cosy with the Garda." When Henry tried to file a complaint at Belmullet police station, "the Super said he felt bad as a family man, like, but there was nothing he could do, it was out of his hands. When I made my statement about harassment, I didn't get so much as the courtesy of a reply from the Garda" ¨C though he did secure back the pictures of his grandchildren changing clothes. "It makes me wonder: who are these people invading our lives and filming our children?"

Ms Horan of Shell said: "We reject the suggestions of heavy-handedness by the security company. IRMS is a reputable company. Their staff are trained to deal professionally with protesters and show them respect." She added: "The main reason we need to have security on this project is to allow our employees to go about their legitimate work and to protect our sites and our equipment." Staff had been "verbally abused, intimidated and prevented from entering their place of work. On one night alone, in 2009, ¡è75,000 of damage was done." IRMS was not answering its telephone in County Kildare last week.

The question of official policing of the Corrib pipeline by the Garda made front-page headlines again last month, when tapes emerged of Garda officers joking about raping women protesters. Demonstrations culminated in one outside the Garda station at the Mayo County seat of Castlebar, home town of the new Taoiseach, Enda Kenny. One of the shamed officers had been transferred here, to a desk job. It was fitting that the demonstration was held in Castlebar, for it was here that Michael Davitt, the son of Mayo who inspired the protest movement, formed the Land League in 1879. Davitt mounted a highly effective campaign against big landowners, leading to the right of tenants to buy their land.

Erris is steeped, then, in the ravages and resistances of Irish history, so the protesters are even more aware than most Irishmen and women that the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising is nigh. For them, the moment is charged with meaning. There is a heart-wrenching passage in O'Domhnaill's film when Pat O'Donnell, arrested, removes and furls the tricolour from the aft of his fishing boat. "The principles of the tricolour were wiped out when they did that to us," spits the Chief now. "People died for that flag and its principles, and if those men knew what was happening now, they'd be turning in their graves."

"I was in the third boat behind the Chief that day," says John Monaghan. "When he took down the tricolour, I felt it, too: they betray everything that was said in the proclamation of 1916, and the constitution. Then the guard puts his hand on the Chief's shoulder and says: 'I'm arresting you now, lad.' It's a seemingly kind gesture, but it's the kiss of Judas."

Mary Corduff, Willie's wife, laments that: "Everyone knew that a certain amount of money would split people, especially in a poor community." None of those who took money from Shell are willing to talk publicly. One man, who sold land for road widening, said simply, as we chatted in a Spar petrol station: "It's best if I'm not making a big thing of it all."

"People still talk to each other," continues Mary, "but it's not the same as before Shell came. All we do now is talk, sleep and eat Shell. You put up another Christmas tree, and all that has happened since you put up the last one is Shell, Shell, Shell. We haven't the life we used to, when between Christmas trees you'd hope to be getting in a bit of silage and have some hay drying."

John Monaghan looks back a couple of weeks to "a day when we were coming out of the depths of winter; the sun was shining through the window, the kids getting ready for school. It all looked so beautiful, the shore down there, the sea and a blue sky ¨C but there they were: the Jeeps, the jackets, the cops, the navy, the choppers and diggers. This is deep stuff, it spoils the sunshine".









Things sometimes go well. The arrest of Ratko Mladic, though long overdue and cynically co-ordinated with Serbia's overtures to the EU, is truly to be welcomed. Rather than a corpse lying in a compound, we have the living individual who ordered the largest mass murder in Europe since the Second World War and now he will stand in court to be confronted with the unimaginable pain that his actions caused in Sarajevo and the Muslim enclave called Silver City ¨C Srebrenica.

Whether justice can really be achieved after such crimes is another matter, but this course is infinitely preferable to the operation carried out against Osama bin Laden at Abbottabad a few weeks ago. However rotten Mladic seems and however dreadful his crimes, with his extradition to the International Criminal Tribunal in the Hague we assert values that are the very opposite of the darkness that descended in the break-up of Yugoslavia. No retribution can be devised to match what he did, but there will be a modest gain for civilisation from his arrival in the Hague, just as there was when John Demjanjuk was sentenced in Germany two weeks ago ¨C 58 years after he helped kill thousands of Jews in the gas chambers of Sobibor.

The massacre of 8,500 Muslims at Srebrenica may have been largely forgotten until last week, but the effects of the events between 10 July and 13 July 1995 are still with us today. Both the rise of Islamism and revival of the doctrine of liberal interventionism ¨C what Lord Palmerston described as England's real policy of championing justice and right ¨C can in part be attributed to the shock of what happened in those three days under the noses of the United Nations, a prevaricating French general, a laissez-faire British government and a force of 700 Unprofor soldiers from Holland who handed the population of Srebrenica to the Serbs after their commander drank plum brandy with Mladic.

Bosnia was a reporters' war: there was no embedding of journalists, there were no definite battle lines, and over the two-and-a-half years of hostilities between Serbs, Muslims and Croats, it produced stories of unbelievable cruelty and heartbreak. Among the many courageous acts by journalists was one by David Rohde, then of the Christian Science Monitor, now of the New York Times. A month after the killings at Srebrenica, he hired a car, went into the countryside not far from the town and found new bullet holes along the walls of farm buildings, evidence of mass graves and such clues among the dead as recently dated receipts from Srebrenica. On a later trip into Serb territory, he was imprisoned by the Bosnian Serbs after finding further evidence at four sites.

I don't claim that Mladic's massacre would have remained hidden without Rohde's reporting ¨C there were plenty of radio intercepts and satellite pictures to suggest what had happened ¨C but the fact that he demonstrated so quickly that 8,500 people had not fled across 43 miles of forest and open countryside towards the Bosnian town of Tuzla, as the Bosnian Serbs claimed, cannot be underestimated. The massacre was so recent ¨C people could remember what they were doing that week in July ¨C and it had occurred in broad daylight on European soil.

What was even more astonishing was that the UN did not seem to have any knowledge of it; still less did the UN officials and soldiers who were meant to be protecting the Bosnian Muslims appear to possess the will to find out. The message that Muslims around the world took to heart was that Muslim lives did not matter to Europeans, a view that was certainly strengthened over the past 16 years by the failure to capture Ratko Mladic. The calculating lassitude of the European powers until the autumn of 1995, particularly the wariness of British politicians and commentators, seems hardly credible today.

And reaction against that paralysis ¨C what the late Richard Holbrook regarded as "the greatest collective security failure of the west since the 1930s" ¨C was the reason behind Tony Blair's 1999 Chicago speech embracing intervention as a moral necessity ¨C not just for Americans. And we all know where that led us.

When Mladic's troops started separating the men and boys from the women in preparation for the massacre, it sent a shockwave into the future that has influenced events until the present day. Only a couple of months ago, as Muammar Gaddafi's mercenaries prepared to enter rebel-held Benghazi, I found myself looking up the timeline of events at Srebrenica. The memory of the massacre clearly galvanised David Cameron, who was never going to be accused of the appeasing policies of the former foreign secretaries Douglas Hurd and Malcolm Rifkind.

On hearing the news of Mladic's arrest, I instantly thought of a man I got to know when visiting Sarajevo and the Republika Srpska to write about the Srebrenica massacre. His name is Hasan Nuhanovic. He is a Bosniak who speaks fluent English and during that summer he served as translator for the Dutch forces guarding his home town of Srebrenica. When the Serbs came, he brought his father, mother and younger brother into the UN compound, in the hope that they would be protected by his contract with the UN. But the Dutch soldiers expelled his family and they were never seen again.

Hasan has borne witness to the horror of that day thousands upon thousands of times. Listening to him, I was always stuck by how utterly pathetic the Dutch were but also how little it would have taken to stop Mladic. The Dutch pleaded for air strikes before the Serbs started their bombardment and the planes actually took off, but then the French General Bertrand Janvier refused permission for the bombing because ¨C I kid you not ¨C the necessary forms had not been properly filled in. The warplanes ran out of fuel and had to return to their carrier, by which time it was too late.

For evil to triumph it is enough only for good men to do nothing. That is what happened in Bosnia and the thousands of deaths caused by Mladic at Sarajevo and Srebrenica were as much a product of European indifference and inaction as they were of Mladic's cruel and bullying nature. His appearance at the Hague will force us to consider again when it is right to intervene and we will remember exactly how he came to do his worst, which may not be a comfortable experience. But justice will be better served ¨C and for victims such as Hasan so will truth ¨C by a living defendant rather than a body riddled with bullets.

Malta has voted yes in a non-binding referendum on legalising divorce, the island's prime minister Lawrence Gonzi has conceded.

Almost three-quarters of the electorate voted on Saturday on whether divorce should be introduced in Malta. With a 95% Catholic majority, Malta is the only EU country not to allow divorce. If the referendum result is upheld by parliament it will leave the Philippines as the only country in the world where married couples cannot divorce each other.

Figures gathered by the electoral commission after polling stations had closed showed that turnout was 72%, according to the Times of Malta. "Even though the result is not what I wished for, now it is our duty to see that the will of the majority is respected," Gonzi said in a televised speech.

Gonzi, who campaigned against the introduction of divorce, said it was now up to parliament to enact a law legalising the dissolution of marriage on the island. The Catholic church supported a no vote during the campaign.

The leader of the yes movement, Jeffrey Pullicino Orlando, of the governing Nationalist party, said the result was significant.

"It brings Malta into a new era where the state and the church are separate," Orlando told the EFE news agency.

The decision of the 306,000 voters of the conservative and deeply traditional Mediterranean island is further evidence of the waning influence of the church. Legal separation is widespread in the European Union's smallest state but there are many obstacles to remarrying.

The church did not campaign before the referendum but Malta's archbishop, Paul Cremona, warned churchgoers in a letter that they faced a choice between building or destroying family values.

Joseph Muscat, the pro-divorce leader of the opposition Labour party, said that a new Malta had been born. He urged a divorce debate in parliament as soon as possible, saying that he was confident that anti-divorce Labour MPs would not thwart the will of the people.

Divorce legislation is expected to squeeze through parliament as the ruling Nationalist party has a one-seat majority.

Mario Fava, a 37-year-old office manager who has been legally separated for seven years with no chance of remarrying, said he was delighted by the result. "It is a very positive outcome, with 54% in favour. After such a long time most people can now make use of this new freedom so definitely it's a step in the right direction.

"Obviously it's very different from a general election so while everybody who voted yes is delighted, there are no street celebrations going on, no car cavalcades or anything like that."

Malta was occupied by Arab invaders in the 10th century before mounting a fierce fightback against an Ottoman siege in 1565. A century-and-a-half of British rule, which ended in 1964, put an Anglo-Saxon stamp on the culture but Malta remained a strongly Catholic country. The country also forbids abortion. Pope Benedict XVI visited the island last year.

For weeks Malta has been plastered with posters showing a picture of a child alongside the slogan: "I trust you with my future ¨C vote No."

In the referendum, Maltese voters were asked whether parliament should introduce a new law that would allow couples to obtain a divorce after four years of separation.

Previously, couples could apply for a legal separation in the courts, or seek a church annulment ¨C a complex process that can take up to nine years. A third option was to get divorced abroad, which would be recognised as valid in Malta.

Chile was the last country to legalise divorce in 2004 after overwhelming public pressure.

Fighting between the yes and no camps continued right up until the polls closed, in spite of a ban on influencing voters. There were local reports of pressure on voters, especially the elderly and vulnerable, to come out and vote against the divorce proposals, while some blog posts showed pictures of elderly people and nuns at the polling station with the caption "are you prepared to leave your future in their hands?"










The departure of the civil service minister, Georges Tron, was announced by the prime minister Photograph: Ian Langsdon/EPA
A French minister has resigned from Nicolas Sarkozy's government after he was put under investigation for allegedly sexually assaulting two women who worked for him.

The departure of the civil service minister, Georges Tron ¨C who denies the allegations ¨C was announced by the prime minister, Fran?ois Fillon, on Sunday.

French prosecutors were in the preliminary stages of investigating accusations of sexual aggression and rape against Tron, whose lawyer, Olivier Schnerb, said were "pure defamation" and "balderdash".

The investigation comes two weeks after the arrest of the former IMF head and Socialist presidential hopeful, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who is facing sexual assault charges in New York.

Tron's position became untenable after the foreign minister, Alain Jupp¨¦, told a television show that although his colleague was "presumed innocent", he should consider resigning because "government ministers had to be above all suspicion."

The two women, aged 34 and 36, have lodged complaints with the public prosecutor, claiming Tron assaulted them between 2007 and 2010 while they worked at the town hall in Draveil, south of Paris, where he is the mayor.

The women claim the assaults started after Tron, who says he is a qualified reflexologist, offered to give the women foot massages. They say it was the arrest of Strauss-Kahn that encouraged them to come forward. "When I see that a little chambermaid is capable of taking on Dominique Strauss-Kahn, I told myself I did not have the right to stay silent," one of them told a French newspaper.

"Other women have perhaps suffered what I have suffered. I have to help them. We have to smash this omerta."

The Strauss-Kahn affair has triggered soul-searching in France about sex and power. After the shock and disbelief of the arrest of the man nicknamed the Great Seducer, French pundits have been questioning whether strict privacy laws and alleged media complicity have enabled politicians and celebrities to get away with unacceptable behaviour. Sunday's edition of the Journal du Dimanche wrote of a "before and an after DSK" (as Strauss-Kahn is known in France).

Strauss-Kahn had already been forced to apologise for a "lack of judgment" after an affair with a junior colleague at the IMF shortly after he took up his post in 2007.

Tristane Banon, a journalist, claimed in 2007 that Strauss-Kahn sexually assaulted her in 2002, but her claims were largely ignored by the mainstream French press and her mother, a Socialist politician and friend of the Strauss-Kahn family persuaded her not to go to the police.

Last week a women's association said one of the women, claiming she had been attacked by Tron, had come forward in November with a "credible" complaint against the 53-year-old minister.

In a statement, the European Association Against Violence Against Women at Work said: "Her credibility is not in question from our point of view."

Tron claims the women have a vendetta against him after being sacked from their jobs. "I am not naive ¨C they are trying to echo an affair taking place the other side of the Atlantic," he told Reuters last week. In an interview prior to his resignation, he said: "The accusations against me are fantasy."









Son of Ratko Mladic speaks: 'He did not order the killings' Link to this video
Ratko Mladic denies ordering the 1995 massacre of 8,000 Muslim men and boys in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica, his son has said.

"Whatever was done in Srebrenica, he has nothing to do with it. His orders were to evacuate the wounded, the women and the children and then the fighters," Darko Mladic said as his father fought extradition from Serbia to face the UN war crimes tribunal in The Hague.

"Whatever was done behind his back, he has nothing to do with that."

The family intends to demand on Monday that a Serbian court orders an independent medical checkup to counter Friday's decision that Mladic is fit to stand trial. "His basic human rights are being violated," his son said.

Prosecutors have dismissed such moves as a delaying tactic.

Ratko Mladic's lawyer, Milos Saljic, said: "It is impossible to talk to him sensibly about usual things, to talk about his defense case ... He is really in bad shape psychologically."

The alleged war criminal, who has previously suffered at least two minor strokes, also said he wanted to be visit the grave of his daughter, who killed herself in 1994.

"He says if he can't go there, he wants his daughter's coffin brought in here," Saljic added. "His condition is alarming."

Meanwhile, Serbian authorities stepped up security ahead of an ultra-nationalist rally scheduled to take place in the capital, Belgrade, later on Sunday. Previous rallies have resulted in violent clashes between the police and rightwing extremists.

Earlier, it emerged that officials involved in Mladic's capture had faced a tirade of abuse when he was brought to court. Mladic accused them of "working for the CIA", and later told one prominent official he could have had him killed on two occasions.

Mladic, who has refused to recognise the authority of the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, denied being a killer, adding that all Serbs bore a shared guilt for voting for President Slobodan Milosevic, the architect of the Balkan wars.

Mladic's behaviour since being brought to court in Belgrade was disclosed in the most detailed account yet of the state of mind of the man charged with orchestrating the Srebrenica massacre and the siege of Sarajevo during the Bosnian war.

It came as a source close to Serbia's intelligence service, the BIA ¨C or Security Information Agency ¨C said Mladic had been living openly for several years, although "not continuously", in the village of Lazarevo, where he was found.

A BIA team observing the house of his cousin Branko Mladic, where Ratko Mladic was found ¨C one of two addresses he had been using in the area ¨C had watched him going about "everyday activities", including attending village celebrations. "Personally speaking, I think some officials knew where he was living," the source said. "It was peculiar, too, that when the house was raided there were no personal possessions there."

Bruno Vekaric, a deputy prosecutor at the war crimes prosecutor's office, who has met Mladic twice since his arrest, described Mladic's behaviour: "He was really angry at first. He recognised me from television and said: 'You're in the CIA!' He knew my name and asked me: 'Are you a Serb?' You know, because it is not a common Serbian name.

"I told him my father was from Dubrovnik [in Croatia]. He felt like a great Serb and was angry at the way he was being treated on that first day."

Vekaric added that examination of Mladic by court-appointed medical experts confirmed he had suffered at least two minor strokes, perhaps more, but was coherent and fit to stand trial.

That was confirmed by Mladic's wife, Bosiljka, speaking after visiting him, who said he had suffered a stroke in 2008.

"He was stubborn and resistant. He did not want to co-operate with the judge at all on the first day," Vekaric said. "He spoke about his career. And what was interesting, on that first day, was that he said to me: 'Bruno, I am not a killer. But the people who killed, they should be held responsible.'"

Vekaric gave his account in his court office above the cells where Mladic is being held in a block on his own, watched 24 hours a day by two guards through an open door.

He said: "He's always observed, but he's told the guards: 'You don't have to worry. I'm not going to commit suicide.'"

Mladic emerges as a man who has a desperate need to explain himself. "He needs to speak. To communicate," said Vekaric. "He was alone for so long, he needs to speak."

Although they had never met before, Mladic made clear to Vekaric that he had followed his statements over the years on television. "The first day, he was very tired," Vekaric said. "He was stressed and aggressive. The second time I saw him in court, he apologised to me for his outburst."

What has been visible since then is a more familiar Mladic, arrogant and demanding, insisting not only on his own innocence but on the shared guilt of all of the Serbian people. "He said: 'You elected [Slobodan] Milosevic, not me. You are all guilty, not me.'"

During his time in court, speaking to officials involved in proceedings to extradite him to The Hague for trial, some details have emerged of how Mladic has lived. He has had no mobile phone, not trusting mobiles or the internet. The television channels he watched were local Serbian ones, and he described cable television as "fed by the CIA".

Mladic also complained about how his family has been treated during the long manhunt. "He asked for his pension [cut off in 2004] to be reinstated. He said: 'You destroyed everything. Because of you my daughter-in-law lost her job. They destroyed the financial connections of my son, Darko'" Vekaric said.

He added that as well as asking for strawberries and a television, which has been delivered to his cell, Mladic had also asked if he could see his grandchildren.

Vekaric said Mladic had suffered increasingly straitened circumstances since 2006, when he narrowly evaded arrest in the village of Ljuba.

This was as a result of the targeting of those in his support network, including financiers, and increased supervision of family members, who had been followed closely by the BIA. "He only had relatives who could look after him," said a source familiar with the BIA operation.

"None of his close family visited him in Lazarevo while the house was being observed. They were being watched too closely."

Vekaric said: "When you see him, you see a man who has not looked after himself well in the last three to four years. He looks like someone who has not had proper medical attention in a long time."









Lunapark Berlin: the disused Spreepark theme park where residents protested against the city's tourism industry. Photograph: Dorothea Tuch
It's a scene Berliners have become well accustomed to now that their home draws 9 million visitors every year: strolling in the park and having to dodge Segways and "conference bikes" pedalled by seven drunken people at once; birdsong drowned out by a tour guide trying to condense a century of history into a narrative consumed like a half-litre of Pilsner.

For once this isn't at Tiergarten park by the Brandenburg Gate, but at Pl?nterwald, in the former east, the venue for a festival this weekend which let local people play at being tourists in their own city.

The number of tourists in Berlin is a hot topic with the city's residents at the moment: earlier this year many column inches were devoted to the debate after a community meeting was convened in the popular Kreuzberg district under the banner "Help! The Tourists Are Coming!".

The weekend's festival, organised by Berlin's leading modern theatre, Hau, Lunapark Berlin was an attempt to ask what future there was for the 3.4 million people who actually live in the city.

"To many young tourists, Berlin appears to be one big pleasure zone," ran Hau's blurb. "If tourism is Berlin's biggest growth industry ¨C making the city hope for 50,000 new jobs over the next few years ¨C where will those relax who provide for the fun for the guests?"

"I'm not anti-tourist," said Hau's curator, Stefanie Wenner, on Saturday. "We are simply asking: is Berlin just turning into one big amusement park for tourists?

"In principle, I think it's good that we receive so many guests. But I think it should be better controlled so that more of the money they bring in goes not into the coffers of private firms but to the state.

Perhaps there should be a tourist tax, for example, where a few euros were added to the cost of each overnight stay."

By a neat coincidence, Wenner's festival was held in the grounds of what was once the only theme park in East Germany. The Kulturpark was built in 1969 as a socialist project to provide entertainment for the proletariat and celebrate 20 years of the German Democratic Republic (GDR).

After the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the attraction was renamed the Spreepark and taken over by a colourful West German family ¨C two members of whom were jailed after 181kg of cocaine was found hidden inside the base of the 1001 Nights Magic Carpet Ride. The owner's daughter, Sabrina Witte, guided visitors around the park and provide a warts-and-all history of how it tore her family apart.

The Spreepark closed in 2001 and has lain dormant for a decade, the enormous ferris wheel poking up above the trees the only reminder of what once was. A family of noisy frogs have moved into the log flume's lake, the spinning tea cups no longer send children dizzy and many of the swan boats have lost their heads. It has long been a favourite haunt for teenagers looking for a trippy place to get stoned, but this weekend was the first time in a decade that the park was open to the public.

For a €5 entry fee, visitors to Lunapark Berlin could explore the grounds ¨C by foot, Segway or conference bike, alone or on guided tours. The Trouble With Tourism Tour was led by a Northern Irish guide called Finn Ballard who told a stream of stories about the stupid things Berlin's visitors say and do. "Once," he said, "I had someone say to me, 'we really want to visit the Third Reich. Please can you show us where it is on the map?' What can you say to that? 'Go to the end of the street and turn right at 1933?'"

A particular bugbear is the way so many tourists see everything through a camera lens ¨C or their mobile phone screens. "They seem to think everything is a video game," said Ballard. "They take a Hipstamatic picture on their iPhone without even knowing what they are taking a picture of, and post it on Facebook without even finding out," he said, adding that while most of his guests are intelligent and well informed, he has seen tourists taking pictures of each other doing peace signs in the gas chambers at Sachsenhausen concentration camp just outside Berlin.

On this theme, one popular attraction at the festival was having your picture taken pretending to be a tourist at Checkpoint Charlie, the former border control between East and West which is now one of Berlin's top tourist attractions.

The highlight came on Saturday night with the lighting of the so-called Burn Out Man ¡ª a monstrous five-metre tall wooden wicker man, which organisers said represented the ills of modern Berlin life.

"We're against what has been called the 'neue M¨¹digkeitsgesellschaft' ¨C the tired society where everyone is mentally kaput and there is no distinction between work and leisure. We're against the North American capitalist model which demands people work all the time," said Nick Duric from the Showcase Beat Le Mot collective.

At 9pm, the Burn Out Man ceremony began with a marching band and a rough and ready choir singing a specially written song which railed against, among other things, Fukushima and capitalism. Duric said Berlin's ramshackle trademarks were being eroded by soulless capitalist projects ¨C particularly a slick development just upstream called Mediaspree, home to the 02 venue, which is trying to position itself as the new centre of Berlin's cultural life. "All there is in Berlin is politics and art. People like the cultural landscape because it is chaotic, disorganised. Take that away and what will we have left?"








Silvio Berlusconi kisses his candidate for mayor of Milan, Letizia Moratti, who fought a vitriolic campaign after trailing six percentage point in the first round. Photograph: Massimo Di Nonno/Getty Images
Voters in Milan have gone to the polls for a crucial test of Silvio Berlusconi's diminished political vigour after his government suffered a fresh blow with the resignation of a minister.

Daniela Melchiorre said on Saturday she had quit her job as industry under-secretary because of his public denigration of Italy's judges and prosecutors during last week's G8 summit in France. Television cameras showed Barack Obama looking perplexed as Berlusconi told him Italy had become "almost a dictatorship of leftwing judges".

The Italian prime minister is a defendant in three trials and risks indictment in a fourth. On Tuesday, a court in Milan is due to begin hearing evidence in a case in which he is accused of paying an underage prostitute and using his influence to cover up the alleged offence.

Government supporters played down the significance of Melchiorre's departure, questioning her motives and depicting her as an opportunist. The former magistrate was a member of the last centre-left government before switching to the right.

But it is such floating MPs who pose the greatest threat to the government's tenuous majority. There is also a risk that Melchiorre's defection could be followed by others if Berlusconi loses control of his native Milan.

Almost 6 million Italian are eligible to vote in mayoral runoffs in 90 towns. But the showdown in Italy's business capital is seen as by far the most significant.

Berlusconi's candidate, Letizia Moratti, trailed by six percentage points in the first round of voting on 15 and 16 May 15. Were she to emerge the loser after polls close on Monday, it would be the first time for nearly 20 years that the right had lost Milan ¨C a stronghold not only of Berlusconi's Freedom People (PdL) movement, but of its coalition partner, the Northern League.

Moratti waged a vitriolic campaign in the runup to the second ballot. She and the prime minister, who has turned the vote for mayor into a referendum on his government, railed at the centre-left's candidate, Giuliano Pisapia. He was accused of wanting to turn Milan into a haven for Roma people and of planning to building a mosque for Islamist extremists.

Early turnout figures suggested the tactics might have had some success. By midday on Sunday, Milan was the only major town in which abstentions were lower than in the first round.

The right's inflammatory rhetoric raised the temperature of an already heated contest. Two people were hurt in a brawl on Saturday between supporters of the opposing candidates.

In Naples, the next biggest city at stake, a fire swept through a PdL electoral office after a similarly ill-tempered campaign. Berlusconi, who flew to the city for the close of campaigning, said he could "categorically exclude" a government crisis were the right defeated.

Much will depend on the reaction of the Northern League, many of whose rank-and-file supporters have declared Berlusconi a liability after the party's disappointing performance in the first round. But the League's leader, Umberto Bossi, has been reluctant to break up the governing coalition.










Work was halted on a massive dam project in Hasankeyf three years ago after the ancient city was flooded. Campaigners fear the government will go ahead with the dam regardless. Photograph: Alamy
Every springtime Pervin ?oban Savran takes her camels and sheep up into the Taurus mountains of southern Turkey, following the same routes along the Goksu river that Yoruk people like her have taken for more than 1,000 years. To many Turks these last nomadic tribes are symbols of the soul of their nation.

Their way of life ¨C and that of millions of small farmers ¨C is being threatened by Turkey's Great Leap Forward, one of the most dramatic and potentially devastating rushes for economic development and prosperity Europe has seen in decades.

Thousands of dam and hydropower schemes are being built on almost all of the main rivers in a pharaonic push to make Turkey a world economic power by the centenary of the republic in 2023.

The ruling AK party, expected to win a record third term in next month's elections, is forcing through a series of gigantic public works projects that include three nuclear power plants ¨C despite Turkey being one of the most seismically active nations on earth.

The first plant, a prototype Russian reactor on the Mediterranean coast near the port of Mersin, is close to a highly active faultline. A second, Japanese-built, plant will soon follow on the Black Sea near the city of Sinop.

Prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan raised eyebrows across the world last month by promising to cut a 40-mile canal between the Black Sea and Marmara to relieve the dangerously overcrowded Bosphorus strait, an idea even he calls his "crazy plan".

He has since topped that by revealing a blueprint for two new cities to relieve earthquake-prone Istanbul. Critics say they will only further extend Europe's largest megalopolis, home already to nearly 17 million people.

It is Erdogan's declaration that Turkey's rivers must no longer "run in vain" and 100% of its hydroelectric potential be harnessed over the next 12 years that has environmentalists most worried. They claim that the rush for hydropower is likely to be even more damaging to Turkey's delicate ecological balance, where desertification and depopulation are already problems.

Hundreds of private companies have been given extraordinary latitude to evict villagers, expropriate private land, clear state forests and steamroller normal planning restrictions to meet the target of 4,000 hydroelectric schemes by 2023. Protestors claim licences have been granted on highly favourable terms, guaranteeing investors four decades of clear profit.

The Turkish Water Assembly, an umbrella group researching the impact of the push for more power, argued that 2 million people could be displaced by the hydropower schemes alone. They accuse the government of riding roughshod over human rights, and Turkey's commitments to preserving its extraordinary biodiversity and cultural heritage, in the name of energy security.

Campaigners fear Ankara is also determined to press ahead with the massive Ilisu dam project on the Tigris river, which was halted three years ago after an international outcry over the flooding of the ancient city of Hasankeyf.

The Ilisu dam is dwarfed by the $4bn Beyhan project on the Euphrates, also in the Kurdish south-east, where fears of the forced evacuation of the local population evokes bitter memories of the mass clearances of Kurdish villagers by the Turkish army during the war with the Kurdish separatist PKK in the 1980s.

Demonstrators intent on converging on Ankara from five corners of the country are still being prevented from reaching the capital after a week-long standoff with riot police outside Ankara. Many, like the Yoruks, had been walking for two months as a part of the Great March of Anatolia, a movement sparked by anger at the hydro plans but which has come to embody growing anxiety that the country is being despoiled in the rush for growth.

While the neo-liberal reforms of the moderately Islamist AK party have been credited with firing the country's runaway growth, the gulf between the rich and poor has widened dramatically, and corruption has increased.

The Turkish government insists it must act radically to safeguard the decade-long boom, with growth this year predicted to top 7% despite the worldwide downturn.

Energy, however, is the achilles heel of the so-called Anatolian tiger, with industry heavily dependent on imported gas from Russia and Iran. Despite making itself the hub of a network of pipelines serving Europe from Russia, Central Asia and Iran, Turkey is even more at the mercy of Moscow and Tehran ¨C a fact dramaticallydemonstrated four years ago when Iran turned off the tap and sent fuel prices in Istanbul soaring overnight.

Erdogan has so far been withering of critics of his Great Leap Forward, accusing them of holding Turkey back. He argued that the hydro projects will bring thousands of jobs to the underdeveloped east, irrigate barren land and reverse the wave of migration to the more prosperous west.

"All investments can have negative outcomes," he said. "But you can't give up just because there can be some negative outcomes. We cannot say that there will be no earthquake, but we will take all the precautions."

After the Fukushima disaster in Japan, his energy minister Taner Yildiz caused consternation by claiming that nuclear power was no more dangerous than staying single, citing studies showing married people tend to live four years longer. Alcohol and smoking posed more danger than nuclear power, he claimed, prompting comparisons with former president Kenan Evren's claim after Chernobyl that "radiation is good for the bones".

Tourism minister Ertugrul Gunay appeared to break ranks, warning that "if the hydroelectric energy projects are carried out in a reckless manner, cutting out each brook, levelling each mountain and destroying forests just to be able to produce a few watts of energy, tourism would be an impossible dream", particularly in the Black Sea region.

His comments came as laws were being drafted to allow nature reserves to be handed over for hydroelectric projects. Still more worrying to campaigners has been the official reaction to the legal morass the plans have created, with almost 100 lawsuits filed in the last two years. Of the 41 cases so far heard, judges have halted 39. Work has often continued in defiance of the courts with the protection of police and gendarmerie.

Each hydro scheme is allowed to take 90% of the water out of a section of river, leaving the remaining 10 % as "lifeline support". After the water travels through the turbines, it is returned to the river, but farmers say much of the water is either lost, polluted or has had the "life taken out of it".

For Yoruks such as Pervin ?oban Savran it is their very survival that is in question. "Nobody in parliament has shown any interest in our cause," she said. "They don't love life, only money. These dams are bringing about our end. Our culture is being destroyed."

Hydroelectric projects on the tributaries of the Goksu river have already severelydamaged traditional pastures, she said. "It has affected us very quickly. But in the end, everyone else will suffer too."

'They want to turn us into slaves'

"They killed me when they took my land," said Sinan Ak?al, a tea grower from the spectacular Senoz valley on the Black Sea. He has watched his local court order the cancellation of the hydropower project his land was expropriated for no less than three times. But each time the Turkish environment ministry, which originally rubber-stamped the project without an environmental impact assessment, overrides the court ruling ¨C and work on the dam continues.

In the meantime, large swaths of forest above the valley have been felled, triggering landslides and soil erosion.

"They've taken my land and they've offered me 15,000 lira [¡ê5,800]. I didn't take it, and I won't take it," said Ak?al, 54. "They just want us to go to the cities and turn us into slaves. But what does 15,000 lira get you in a city? In a year the money will run out.

"Where I come from, people don't have a lot of arable land, but we grow corn, potatoes, tea and vegetables and we have everything we need. I don't need huge amounts more of electricity, it is not going to benefit us. My mother is 84, and she can't live anywhere else."

He added: "The talking is going nowhere. Again and again we went to court ¨C again and again the courts sided with us. But they didn't stop, they just kept on working, cutting trees, dirtying the water. In total we have counted 25,000 dead fish in our stream."










Michael McFaul has been Barack Obama's advisor on Russia. Photograph: Vladimir Pirogov/Reuters
Michael McFaul, the architect of the Obama administration's policy of "resetting" US-Russian relations, will be the new American ambassador in Moscow.

The appointment of Barack Obama's chief adviser to a post normally filled by a diplomat is intended as a message to the Kremlin about the importance Washington puts on improving an often testy relationship.

McFaul has been a constant White House advocate of the need to pay close attention to Moscow's views to reduce friction in the UN security council and achieve further progress in arms control.

One of the diplomatic high points of the Obama administration so far, the new Start treaty with Russia on limiting long-range nuclear missiles, which entered into force in February, was largely a result of the White House's decision to "reset" bilateral relations,after years of poor relations. McFaul was one of the policy's leading proponents.

"It is our intention to build a multidimensional relationship with Russia, not simply one about arms control," McFaul said after a meeting on Friday between Obama and the Russian president, Dmitry Medvedev, during the G8 summit in Deauville in France. "The two presidents have pledged to that and particularly on economic relations, to try to expand the scope of things we do together."

McFaul's priorities in his new job will be to negotiate Russian membership of the World Trade Organisation, maintain US supply routes to Afghanistan through Russia, and work towards a deal on missile defence.

The Bush administration's plans to set up a system of radars and missile interceptors in eastern Europe was the main source of tension in US-Russian relations. The US said it was a defence against a future Iranian missile threat, while Moscow saw it as an American bid to undermine the Russian nuclear deterrent.

The Obama administration has opted for a more gradual, "phased adaptive" approach, but it has only served to postpone a confrontation with Russia until the system reaches its later phases in the next seven years.

The Russian chief of the army general staff, General Nikolai Makarov, said on Friday: "I am certain that this moment will be the start of a new stage in the arms race that no one wants, particularly in the current economic climate."

William Perry, a former US defence secretary, said that back-channel talks he was chairing between US and Russian had been making progress.

"It is plain that the experts on both sides believe it is possible to build a system in which the two countries exchange data. Their radar system are better located and we have better radars. Both sides can benefit," he said.

Moscow however wanted control over the eastern sector of Nato's missile defence systems and a written pledge that the system will never be used against Russia.

Perry thought neither proposal was acceptable to the US. "I think if we try to make it a treaty, we are not going to get anywhere," he said.










So, Barack Obama is two-timing us Brits again. Only last Wednesday he was shamelessly flattering us as if we were his favourite auntie. No cliche about Anglo-American relationships was too corny to be overlooked; our relationship was more than just "special", it was "essential". Just how special is that?

But that was days ago. Next came France, for the G8 summit, and he had other people to butter up. Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, for example. Obviously Obama couldn't bang on about shared values and the rule of law because the Kremlin has been a consistent source of autocratic rule since Moscow princes got ideas above their station and started calling themselves Caesar ¨C or czar. But "outstanding" ¨C as the Russian-American relationship was characterised ¨C that's a suitably ambiguous adjective. And for the visit to Ireland, the White House lexicon came up with the "enduring" relationship, which is certainly true genetically ¨C given the ever-expanding number of Americans who claim to be Irish.But who are we to complain? It's a big world and everyone wants a White House adjective to copyright. How about a few more?

? The on-off relationship That would be France. It helped the US win independence from You Know Who but has been rescued so often since then that it needs to show ingratitude. Being shorter than De Gaulle, Sarko is sucking up. It won't last.

? The open relationship That must be Canada. Nuff said.

? The failed relationship Mexico, perhaps, after the drugs and migrant battles. "Poor Mexico, so far from God, so close to the US," as one Mexican dictator put it.

? The loving relationship If it can't be Ireland, it must be Italy, which has better food.

? The long-distance relationship That one must be China. It's a long way across the Pacific ¨C and the Sino-US relationship is going to go the distance. In fact, it is likely to be the key relationship of the 21st century, which may make the rest of us fearful that it doesn't turn into the ugly relationship. A lot of folk could get hurt.










Serbian police clashed with ultra-nationalists after thousands of people rallied in Belgrade to protest against the arrest and proposed extradition of Ratko Mladic, on charges of genocide.

Rioters overturned rubbish bins, broke traffic lights and set off firecrackers as they rampaged through the city centre after a rally at which protesters sang nationalist anthems and chanted slogans against President Boris Tadic, who ordered Mladic's arrest on Thursday. About 3,000 riot police had taken up positions at government buildings and western embassies.

The protests came as the 69-year-old former Bosnian Serb general denied, through his son, responsibility for the massacre at Srebrenica in 1995, the worst atrocity Europe has witnessed since the Nazi era.

Mladic is fighting extradition to the international criminal tribunal in The Hague on health grounds and his lawyer said he would send the appeal by post to gain time. A ruling is not expected before Tuesday at the earliest.

At least 7,000 demonstrators, many singing nationalist songs and carrying banners honouring Mladic, took part in the protest rally in Belgrade, which was called by the Serbian Radical party. Its leader, Vojislav Seselj, is in The Hague also facing war crimes charges. The demonstrations were aimed at Tadic's government, which orchestrated the manhunt for Mladic and his arrest at his cousin's house in the northern Serbian village of Lazarevo after 16 years on the run.

In the clashes on Sunday night, about 100 people were arrested and 16 were injured, including six police.

Vjerica Radeta, a Radical party official, had told reporters that the rally would be held under the title: "Co-operation with The Hague tribunal is a betrayal of Serbian national interests."

Radeta said she did not expect riots as "members and supporters of the Radical party have never been in any extremist groups".

The government deployed riot police in the capital two years ago to avert the violence that followed the arrest of the former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic, when demonstrators ransacked the US embassy in Belgrade.

Serbia's labour minister, Rasim Ljajic, who is head of a national council for relations with The Hague, acknowledged that Mladic's arrest could cost the ruling party the next election.

"We knew that a majority of citizens were against his extradition to The Hague," Ljajic told the Bosnian newspaper Dnevni Avaz. "All polls showed it, including the last one we did about 10 days ago. It showed that 51% of Serbian citizens opposed his extradition and that 34% were for it."

Ljajic said far-right groups would probably benefit from the discontent, but he said the government had decided it was in the interests of Serbia, as it would aid reconciliation in the region.

Meanwhile, in Bosnia, about 3,000 of Mladic's admirers gathered at his childhood home in the eastern town of Kalinovik, and many also went to the shack where he was born in the nearby village of Bozanici, where relatives regaled them with stories of Mladic's childhood.

In Belgrade, Mladic's son Darko said that the ex-general had denied responsibility for the Srebrenica massacre in July 1995, despite the fact that he commanded the Bosnian Serb troops that overran the Muslim enclave.

"He said that whatever was done in Srebrenica, he had nothing to do with it," Darko Mladic said after visiting his father in his police cell.

"He saved so many women, children and fighters ... His order was first to evacuate the wounded, women and children and then fighters."

Mladic's lawyer, meanwhile, is fighting extradition on the grounds of his mental state, arguing he is not fit to stand trial.

"It is impossible to talk to him sensibly about usual things, to talk about his defence case," the lawyer, Milos Saljic said. "Because he is really in bad shape psychologically."

Saljic said that the former commander repeatedly demanded to visit the grave of his daughter, Ana, who killed herself using one of his pistols in 1994.

"He says if he can't go there, he wants his daughter's coffin brought in here," Saljic added. "His condition is alarming."

A Serbian official said that there had been a provisional court ruling allowing Mladic to visit the grave, but that the security services would probably veto the decision.

Serbia's deputy war crimes prosecutor, Bruno Vekaric, rejected the suggestion there was anything wrong with Mladic's mental health. "He understands everything, he speaks about everything," Vekaric told the New York Times. "My impression is that there is no problem for a trial."

A former Hague prosecutor, Carla del Ponte, said on Sunday she expected the arrest of the

Serb war crimes suspect still on the run, Goran Hadzic, who is wanted for war crimes allegedly committed when he ran a rebel Serb enclave in Croatia from 1991 to 1995.

Del Ponte told the Swiss weekly SonntagsZeitung that when she left the prosecutor's office in 2007 it was thought that Hadzic was in Serbia.

Del Ponte said that Serb authorities had "concentrated on Mladic" and that now he had been arrested " Serbia will certainly be looking intensively for Hadzic."

She says that if Hadzic is still in Serbia "then one can assume he will be arrested".

? The following correction was printed in the Guardian's Corrections and clarifications column, Tuesday 31 May 2011. Mentioning a previous government deployment of riot police in Belgrade, an article said this was occasioned two years ago by protests over the arrest of the former Bosnian Serb political leader Radovan Karadzic, 'when demonstrators ransacked the US embassy in Belgrade'. The police deployment, and the rampage at the embassy, was actually sparked in February 2008 by US recognition of Kosovo as an entity independent of the Republic of Serbia











Across the bottom of one of Tracey Emin's visceral, madcap rugs on display in the Hayward, there's a sentence that carries a jolt. "The past is a heavy place," it reads, which is more or less what the Queen was saying in Dublin when she admitted, with "historical hindsight", that maybe the Black and Tans weren't Britain's best-ever invention. Sorry, so sorry? Not quite. But wince a little as you head on to Benghazi via the Srebrenica ring road.

It's fashionable already to cluck apprehensively over Libya. Another botched adventure, another unwanted war. Look how much it's costing ¨C at this rate, more or less your standard Ministry of Defence project overrun before 2011's out. Why isn't it over long since? Why, for all his soaring rhetoric, has Barack Obama decided to rest on his oars? David Cameron broods over sending in four Apache helicopters while the BBC lugubriously reminds us that helicopters can get shot down. If you want to confect a stew of gloom, then any old ingredients will do.

But mix a pinch of foresight with your hindsight, and sprinkle lightly with added realism. Libya isn't Afghanistan or Iraq. It isn't even a proper war, more a series of skirmishes strung out along a long coastal strip. Oh! TV reporters talk excitedly as though this was some mighty contest between opposing armies, but they don't even seem to look at their own pictures. In fact, it's rag-tag stuff on both sides. There are casualties, of course; but the numbers involved seem relatively small. The colonel's mercenary regiments are brutal, but militarily feeble. Take away air cover and they're going nowhere. Will four British Apaches ¨C count them again, yes just four! ¨C make a big difference this week? Merely posing the question helps define this mini-conflict. Its costs and its risks aren't worth so much rumbling angst.

Recent history tells us Muammar Gaddafi is a menace (especially if you're in a jumbo jet over Scotland). When he vowed to take revenge on the insurgents, these were no idle threats. His first reaction when the citizens of his second city marched for change was to shoot them down. The chief prosecutor in The Hague already thinks that, just like Ratko Mladic, Gaddafi has a case to answer. On 18 March, as the allies finally prepared to move, his troops were driving into the outer suburbs of Benghazi. No hindsight necessary: it was five minutes to midnight. And no shucking off our own leaders' responsibility, either.

After Tunisia, after Egypt, the word was the same from Obama to Nicolas Sarkozy to Cameron. The US Senate, the European parliament, the Arab League and the UN security council all knew what had to be done. So did Gaddafi's man at the UN. There was massacre pending. All the usual recourses had been duly employed: sanctions, seizing overseas assets and the rest. But it wasn't enough. Hundreds ¨C probably thousands ¨C of Libyan protesters we'd directly encouraged were about to get shot. Do nothing? Then or now, with or without hindsight, it's a no-brainer.

And the weirdest thing is that precisely the people who champion the rule of international law ¨C people who want Mladic brought to trial ¨C are the ones who seek softer, gentler ways of getting Gaddafi off the hook. (Don't prevent crime in the first place, it seems.) Is Libya the Srebrenica story all over again? Not quite, because then Joe Public wasn't allowed to see quite so clearly what the consequences of cowardice in Bosnia would be.

This time round, though, there was no complexity whatsoever when limited no-fly-and-no-kill action began. It was saving lives threatened by a war criminal who only needed to walk away to end the crisis. The past is a heavy place, to be sure: but it's heaviest of all when hindsight told you what had to be done, and you did nothing.












Moves to cut carbon emissions in line with international targets have come under renewed strain since the nuclear crisis in Japan led some countries to shelve plans to use the technology.

Switzerland became the latest country to decide to phase out nuclear power last week, citing concerns over the accident at the Fukushima plant that was left stricken by a 9.0 magnitude earthquake and tsunami in March.

The Swiss decision not to build any new nuclear stations ¨C three were in the pipeline ¨C follows similar announcements in Germany, Italy and further afield in Thailand and Malaysia, where governments have opted to freeze or forgo plans to build nuclear power stations.

The Swiss government said it would phase out nuclear power by 2034, a decision that requires the closure of five nuclear plants that provide 40% of the country's electricity. No plants will be phased out of use ahead of schedule, however. An estimated 20,000 people protested in Switzerland last weekend against nuclear power in the country.

To make up the shortfall, Switzerland will be forced to rely more on hydroelectric power, much of which it now exports as green energy to neighbouring countries, including Germany and Italy.

In Germany, Europe's largest economy and power market, seven nuclear power plants have been closed and plans to extend the running life of the remaining reactors have been put on hold pending the formation of a new energy policy due in July.

The International Energy Agency warned on Friday that Germany's moratorium on nuclear power will add 25m tonnes a year to the country's carbon dioxide emissions.

Plans to build nuclear power stations in earthquake-prone Italy have been halted, as have projects for five plants in Thailand. Malaysia, which had hoped to switch on its first nuclear station in 2021, will reconsider after reviewing the crisis at Fukushima.

Ruling out nuclear power will make countries more reliant on low-carbon alternatives, some of which have yet to prove themselves on an industrial scale, such as carbon capture and storage, which removes carbon dioxide gas from fossil fuel power stations.

"The decision you make by excluding a technology is that you have to rely on the others. It doesn't necessarily mean your energy system is more carbon intensive or more costly, but you have to replace that excluded technology with something else," said Jeff Hardy at the UK Energy Research Centre.

"Some of the alternatives, like burning fossil fuels with carbon capture and storage, are not yet proven at full scale, so if they don't deliver, or deliver late, that can affect your plans," he added.

In a report by government advisers last week, nuclear power was singled out as the cheapest way for the UK to grow a low-carbon energy supply, at least over the next decade.

The influential committee on climate change envisaged nuclear and renewable energy as having a 40% share each of the energy mix.











The counter-revolution in economics is almost complete. A flirtation with alternative thinking lasted for the six months between the near collapse of the banking system in late 2008 and the London G20 summit in April 2009. Since then, the forces of economic orthodoxy have regrouped and fought back.

There was always going to be a backlash against more interventionist policies because those who fervently believe that markets never lie, that budgets should always balance and that government is always bad were well dug in on university campuses, in finance ministries and in some central banks.

Even so, the world has returned to the pre-crisis mindset with remarkable speed. In 2008, policymakers prescribed a strong dose of John Maynard Keynes to stave off a full-scale slump. Today, the solution for Greece, burdened with debts it has not a hope of paying, is belt-tightening and privatisation. The way to bring down global unemployment, which stands at more than 200 million, is wage flexibility. The blueprint for reform of the financial sector is to do as little as possible lest it deter the money-changers from returning to the temple.

In some places, resistance continues. Barack Obama persists in his heretical view that the United States should restore its economy to health before cutting the deficit. The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England are holding out against the clamour for higher interest rates to tackle inflation. But prospects for a fundamental shift in economic policy, which looked promising two years ago, have dimmed.

Why did this happen? It is a complex story, but the explanation perhaps lies in the fact that it took the born-again Keynesians of 2008-09 an awful long time to admit the error of their ways. Having bought fully into the free-market consensus, they received precious little credit for abandoning the old dogma when the collapse of Lehman Brothers threatened a return to the 1930s.

U-turn

In Britain, there is a precedent for this. Between 1990 and 1992, John Major insisted that the pound had to stay in the exchange rate mechanism, even though pegging the pound to the German mark was making the recession deeper and longer. When sterling was eventually forced out of the ERM in September 1992, interest rates were slashed, the pound depreciated by 15% and economic recovery began almost immediately. But because the U-turn had been forced upon him, Major received brickbats rather than bouquets.

The same, I suspect, applies to Gordon Brown and the Labour party, which rediscovered the virtues of government activism only after 10 years of egregious sucking up to the City.

It has to be acknowledged, also, that the forces of orthodoxy have played a blinder. They have constructed a narrative that blames Bill Clinton for the subprime mortgage crisis (he forced the banks to lend money in order to spread home ownership to the poor), and profligate governments rather than unchecked global finance for the worst recession since the second world war. They have been helped in the construction of this storyline by the feebleness of progressive parties, who have given the impression that they too would be more comfortable returning to "business as usual" (or something closely approximating to it) as quickly as possible.

In one sense, the arguments of the orthodox school are right on the money. The crisis of 2007-08 was caused by an excess of debt, so why, they argue, should the solution to that crisis be still more debt? Voters seem to buy the idea that there is no easy way out of this predicament, and in over-leveraged countries like the US and the UK they are right about that. But it was interesting last week to find the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ¨C hitherto a bastion of fiscal rectitude and George Osborne's number-one supporter ¨C starting to get cold feet about the pace of budget cuts in the UK. The OECD has cut its forecasts for UK growth this year and next; if the thinktank is right, Britain will have its weakest recovery from recession since the 1920s.

In this context, it is worth mentioning an article written for the Times by Keynes in May 1933 ¨C a copy of which was kindly sent to me by a Guardian reader. Showing that little changes in policy debates, Keynes expresses concerns about the economy despite a pick-up in activity since Britain's departure from the Gold Standard in 1931. Keynes writes: "Confidence has been restored and cheap money established both on long and on short term [the equivalent of zero interest rates and quantitative easing from the Bank of England today]. Yet unemployment has not declined. Where are we to look for the explanation? Not in the international sphere; for our net foreign trade position, though still bad, is much improved [the equivalent of the increase in net exports caused by the 25% depreciation of sterling since 2007].

"We can find it nowhere, I suggest, except in the decline in our loan expenditure, as the result of our no longer borrowing for the dole and of our restraining the capital expenditure of all public authorities."

Keynes made the case for tax cuts and infrastructure spending to boost growth and reduce unemployment. He made it clear he had little time for fiscal masochism, noting drily: "Unfortunately the more pessimistic the chancellor's policy, the more likely it is that pessimistic anticipations will be realised and vice versa. Whatever the chancellor dreams will come true!"

Warning

Comparisons with the 1930s can be overdone. Britain's public finances were then in a much healthier state than they are today, while the country's industrial base was much larger. But Keynes's essay is a clear warning to finance ministers who believe they can slash their way to prosperity.A more contemporary critique of the current policy configuration emerged last week from one of Keynes's modern disciples, Joe Stiglitz. In the foreword to a book produced by the European Trade Union Institute (Exiting from the crisis: towards a model of more equitable and sustainable growth), Stiglitz argues that fiscal consolidations almost always lead to cutbacks in services to working men and women, while austerity leads to even higher unemployment, putting further pressure on wages and, therefore, overall demand in the economy.

The position, seen from this perspective, is as follows. For the first half of the postwar period, the strength of trade unions ensured that income gains were shared across all sections of the population and income inequality declined. Since the 1970s, real wages for those in the middle and at the bottom of the income distribution have been squeezed hard. Income inequality has increased as trade unions have declined in influence. Equity withdrawal from rising property prices and much higher levels of debt filled the gap left by the stagnation of real wages until the summer of 2007, but the pressures on the so-called "squeezed middle" are now intense. These pressures will not be eased without pro-growth macro-economic policies, activist industrial strategies, stronger unions, higher real incomes across the board, and tougher action against inequality. A return to the Anglo-Saxon model will lead to stagnation, higher unemployment and even bigger public-sector deficits.










Neckarwestheim nuclear plant in Germany - the country will shut all its nuclear reactors by 2022. Photograph: Michael Probst/AP
Germany will shut all its nuclear reactors by 2022, parties in Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition government agreed on Monday, in a reaction to Japan's Fukushima disaster that marks a drastic policy reversal.

As expected, the coalition wants to keep the eight oldest of Germany's 17 nuclear reactors permanently shut. Seven were closed temporarily in March, just after the earthquake and tsunami hit Fukushima. One has been off the grid for years.

Another six would be taken offline by 2021, environment minister Norbert Roettgen said early on Monday after late-night talks in the chancellor's office between leaders of the centre-right coalition.

The remaining three reactors, Germany's newest, would stay open until 2022 as a safety buffer to ensure no disruption to power supply, he said.

Merkel backtracked in March on an unpopular decision just months earlier to extend the life of ageing nuclear stations in Germany, where the majority of voters oppose atomic energy.

Her Christian Democrats (CDU), their Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU) and junior coalition partner the Free Democrats (FDP) met on Sunday after an ethics commission ended its deliberations this weekend.

"It's definite: the latest end for the last three nuclear power plants is 2022," Roettgen said after the meeting. "There will be no clause for revision."

Some politicians had wanted a clause allowing for the agreement to be revised in future. The FDP had wanted no firm date but rather a flexible window for the exit, plus the option of bringing back at least one of the seven oldest nuclear reactors in case of emergency.

The coalition agreed to keep one of the older reactors as a "cold reserve" for 2013 if the transition to renewable energies cannot meet winter demand and if fossil fuels do not suffice to make up for a potential shortfall.

A massive earthquake and tsunami in March crippled Japan's Fukushima plant, causing releases of radioactivity, sparking calls for tougher global safety measures and prompting some governments to reconsider their nuclear energy strategy.

The German decision still needs to go through parliament and leaders of the opposition Social Democrats and Greens were present at parts of the meeting to enable a broad consensus.

The decision could still face opposition from RWE, E.ON, Vattenfall and EnBW, the utility companies that run the 17 plants, mostly because of plans to keep a disputed nuclear fuel rod tax.

The coalition wants to retain the tax, which was expected to raise €2.3bn ($3.29bn) a year starting this year but so far has not been levied. With the immediate exit of eight plants it will raise less than envisaged.

Sources had said the government was mulling scrapping the tax in return for the four big power providers supporting an earlier exit from nuclear energy and not suing the government for its policy U-turn.

Juergen Grossmann, chief executive of the biggest power provider, RWE, has lobbied for nuclear plants to stay open longer, arguing a quick exit would cost energy-intensive industry dearly and could threaten Germany's industrial base.

Before Merkel shut down the oldest plants for three months, Germany got 23% of its power from nuclear plants.

Her about-turn has done little to regain her support but has drawn scorn from the opposition and from within her own party ranks. Tens of thousands of people demonstrated against nuclear energy at the weekend across Germany.

Nuclear policy is heavily disputed in Germany and the issue has helped boost the Greens, who captured control of one of the CDU's stronghold states, Baden-Wuerttemberg, in an election in March.

Merkel's majority in the Bundesrat upper house vanished last year after the CDU failed to hold on to North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany's most populous state. Losing Baden-Wuerttemberg, a vote held after Fukushima and fought in part over energy issues, dealt another blow to Merkel's authority.

Group chief executive officer of Independent News and Media Gavin O'Reilly. Photograph: Josep Lago/AFP/Getty Images
Gavin O'Reilly may hail from Sir Anthony O'Reilly's clan, but the last couple of years have not been easy. The Independent News & Media his father ran for 36 years was handed over to Gavin (one of his brood of six) just as the group descended into near-bankruptcy. Unable to pay off a €200m (¡ê173m) bond, Independent ¨C Ireland's largest newspaper group ¨C was forced into a dismal restructuring that saw its shareholders take a hit while a string of assets had to be sold off, including the Independent in London, sold to oligarch Alexander Lebedev for a token ¡ê1.

The result was that Sir Anthony's controlling 29% stake was more than halved ¨C as was a similar-sized holding belonging to controversial entrepreneur Denis O'Brien, who had lost €0.5bn on his investment. That, though, was not all ¨C as the corporate rescue unfolded, the Irish economy hit the buffers ¨C leaving the new company to contend with a new financial landscape in its home territory. Meanwhile, in the wings there remains a surly O'Brien, rebuilding his stake, launching complaints about fellow board members ¨C and a new player, Dermot Desmond, who has latterly come on to the share register. Add it all up ¨C recessions, egos ¨C and there's plenty for Gavin O'Reilly to contend with.

"Hindsight is a wonderful thing," says O'Reilly. "We had a 10-year bond maturing in the middle of the greatest economic implosion the world has ever seen. Unfortunately we were also saddled with banks that had their own problems. We wanted to issue a new bond, but we weren't allowed to do that. The banks just wanted the bond out of the capital structure." O'Reilly won't blame any individual lenders ¨C although the Independent roster consists of all the familiar Irish names ¨C but he believes he learned "a large degree of self-reliance" from the months of negotiations that led to the bond converting into shares worth half the company.

Minority stake

O'Reilly is fortunate to still be in his job, as senior executives often lose their position in such restructurings. The casualties, though, were elsewhere, with the disposals of a minority stake in India's number one daily, and the Independent in London. Lebedev, O'Reilly says, has "taken on a brave and admirable task" and he is quick to praise the new owners for launching the i, before adding: "I can't tell you anything about the financials ¨C I don't concern myself about the London newspaper market any more". The result is that IN&M is freed of some ¡ê15m of annual losses, and a title whose ownership by the company had become an obsession for some, not least O'Brien who repeatedly demanded its sale as the parent company ran into trouble.

"It became a cause celebre for a lot of people," O'Reilly concedes, before pointing out with more than a hint of frustration that every time his management team attempted to cut costs and staunch losses at the Indy, the market moved against him. "The UK newspaper market is currently dysfunctional; there are players who run up losses far greater than those of the Independent" by which he means the Guardian and the Times ¨C yet, he points out, it was the Indy's smaller deficits that were treated as far more serious. That may be true, but the Indy was fourth of four in the general quality market, as measured by copies bought and sold, making its position more precarious. He promises too, never to return to London; if the Express is for sale, no bid is coming from O'Reilly whose company has a half interest in Richard Desmond's Irish Daily Star.

Then there's Ireland, the company's historic core, where the business is built around the market-leading Irish Independent ¨C but a country whose stereotypical broadcast news image today is the unfinished housing estate. "Property advertising is 5% of its peak," says O'Reilly and the wider ad market is at least 50% down from its peak in 2008. "Advertising fell 39% in 2009, by 13% in 2010 and it's down in the mid-single digits in the year to date," the chief executive says, surprisingly philosophically. It was a downturn that the Sunday Tribune could not survive ¨C the fourth ranked local Sunday title was only 29.9% owned by Independent News & Media, but was funded by the company. "Look it was very much the fourth paper in a crowded market, and in a tightening market there tends to be consolidation in number one or two brands. We believed it was in the best interests of our shareholders to cease funding," he concludes ¨C describing a decision that saved another €3-4m in annual losses, while 41 employees had to scramble to find jobs elsewhere.

Yet, that may be all the bad news. The company's Irish operations ¨C which include the Belfast Telegraph in the north ¨C generated €53.2m operating profit last year, on turnover of €399m. That may be half 2007 levels (half that is excluding any contribution from the Belfast Telegraph, which used to be part of a now defunct UK division), but with a bottom-of-the-cycle profit margin which is still 13.5% ¨C and closer to 20% when you strip out the less profitable contract printing operations (IN&M prints many London¨Cowned newspapers across the island of Ireland). "We're the only profitable newspaper group in Ireland," O'Reilly argues, and predicts that advertising will "return to sustainable growth in 2012," helped in part by the easier comparatives with the bombed-out 2011 performance. Meanwhile, with the Sunday Tribune and the London Independent gone, "every single newspaper in the company is profitable".

The rest of the group consists of the leading newspaper company in South Africa ¨C with titles such as the Johannesburg Star, the Daily Voice in Cape Town, and the fast growing Isolezwe Zulu title, which has a circulation of over 100,000 six years after launch. South Africa is close to becoming the group's number one business, with €43.5m of operating profit in 2010, and is an obvious area for organic growth if the company focuses on local language publishing in the fashion of Isolezwe. There's also a 31% holding in APN, the owner of the New Zealand Herald, and the second biggest publisher of regional titles in Australia, part of Sir Anthony's legacy of building up operations in most of the world's great rugby playing nations - all of which provides a dividend income of about €15m and Ireland and South Africa add up to a company total net profit of €111.9m for last year.

All that's left to do financially, then, is deal with the debt, at €473m at the end of last year, which amounts to 4.1 times underlying earnings. That's the kind of figure that used to be considered easily manageable, but O'Reilly says the company will only be comfortable when borrowings are "between two and three times. We should get to three times in 2012, depending on the quality of the advertising recovery". There is even talk of seeking more investment opportunities in developing markets, in newspapers, and possibly also other media, most notably outdoor (the company was forced to sell its South African outdoor business a year ahead of the World Cup in the country) - where it sees particular hope for growth.

Property issues

O'Reilly may have to contend with one or two testy billionaires first. Gavin's father has been unable to increase his stake ¨C Sir Anthony's holding is marooned at 13.3%, suggesting that after problems with other businesses, most notably the collapsed Waterford Wedgwood as well as other property issues, he has little or no spare cash to spend. Meanwhile, Denis O'Brien has been buying, lifting his holding to 22% ¨C and gradually disturbing. O'Brien, with three seats on the board, has been agitating for more influence, choosing to criticise vice-chairman Bengt Braun - a former chief executive of Scandinavian media group Bonnier. Braun, O'Brien's directors argue, is not independent because he was chairman of the World Association of Newspapers (WAN) between 1998 and 2000 ¨C a position now filled by Gavin O'Reilly.

"It's a peculiar position to take," argues O'Reilly, pointing out that WAN is "a large body with 107 board members" and that its membership is exactly whom one might want to select newspaper company board members from. "This didn't need to occur, Braun is assuredly independent, and lots of institutions see it that way." Braun is expected to carry the vote this Friday at the company's annual meeting ¨C but the question will be whether he has the appetite to remain on a board with such tensions in the background. Which, of course, may be O'Brien's goal.

There is much talk about O'Brien being a business foe of Gavin O'Reilly's father; O'Brien was once beaten by a Sir Anthony O'Reilly-led bid for the fixed-line phone company Eircom. Nor is he close to the son: "I've seen Denis, before Christmas. We had a full and frank discussion about the way he sees the business, and the way I see the business," before Gavin tactfully notes that "he's on the outside looking in". Then there are those among reporting staff who worry about O'Brien's controversial past ¨C in April after 14 years of enquiry the Moriarty tribunal concluded that O'Brien was secretly helped by former communications minister Michael Lowry in winning the country's second mobile phone contract in 1995. The report also noted that a payment of IR¡ê147,000 was made from O'Brien to Lowry via an intermediary "in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference that the motive for making the payment was connected with the public office of minister". But Gavin O'Reilly knows better than to get heavily drawn into that debate with his largest shareholder ¨C who has on many occasions complained about the reporting of his business affairs by Independent tiles.

Then there's Dermot Desmond, a serial investor and Celtic shareholder, who has just taken a 2% stake, and a friend of O'Brien's. "He's a very successful businessman; I'm just not sure if he loves the media or hates the media," O'Reilly says, code for saying there have been plenty of libel disputes down the years ¨C including a 10-year-old battle with the Sunday Tribune that was only settled with an apology from the Tribune after it was closed and amid some heavy behind-the-scenes negotiation.

On this occasion, O'Reilly does not believe he is acting in concert with O'Brien ¨C preferring to take an optimistic view. "If you look at Dermot Desmond's track record, he's a pretty shrewd investor," which is yet another way of saying if O'Reilly can hang onto power, Independent News & Media can only ¨C surely ¨C recover from here.












The IMF is expected to make an announcement later today in which it declares Kosovo's programme to be off-track. This would be a rare event, because governments seldom break their commitments to the IMF. Since its controversial declaration of independence in 2008, Kosovo has struggled to be accepted in the international community; recognised by fewer than half of the UN member states, its only success so far was to enter into the IMF and the World Bank. It wanted an IMF programme to strengthen its credibility and to satisfy conditions tied to large grants from the EU and the World Bank. Now, however, both money and credibility look to be lost, and the irresponsibility of its government is leading Kosovo towards a fiscal crisis.

How could this happen, in the world's most closely supervised nation? Kosovo is very poor. It exports almost nothing but its workers, and its economy still depend on their remittances and international aid. Widespread unemployment, poverty and corruption breed growing discontent. But its incompetent and often predatory elite is free from accountability: the judicial system is dysfunctional and subject to political interference, civil society weak and elections ¨C regularly tainted by fraud ¨C attract less than half of the voters.

Kosovo used to be a neglected province of Serbia. But after its secession the contrast became even starker: although Serbia still suffers from the legacy of the wars and isolation of the 1990s, the quality of its democracy is better, its economy stronger, and now ¨C after the arrest on Thursday of Ratko Mladi?, its hopes of EU membership took a leap forward.

To help Kosovo mature into a more open and stable society, its institutions were placed under the supervision of a watchdog ¨C the International Civilian Office (ICO), whose economics office I led until last March ¨C whose mandate covers anything between human rights, economic policy and trade in church candles. This mandate was backed by strong remedial powers for whose exercise, however, the ICO had to rely on the political power of its European and American masters. And these masters have diverging interests.

Kosovo owes its independence to the US, and the US continues to exercise huge influence; yet, an ocean away, Washington can afford to be uninterested in the long-term development of Kosovo, and uses its influence to serve its own bilateral interests and ensure short-term political stability. Conversely, to European eyes Kosovo is the most problematic corner of a still unstable enclave ¨C the western Balkans ¨C locked within the EU's borders, and a source of increasingly unpopular migration. Europe, unlike the US, has a stake in its development and provides most of the aid, but lacks influence (mainly because the EU is divided: five member states do not recognise Kosovo).

These differences are highlighted by the episode that felled the IMF programme. On the eve of national elections the government promised civil servants a pay rise of 30% to 50% (by way of comparison, a week into the protests that brought him down, Egypt's president Mubarak promised a 15% salary increase). This fundamentally wrong measure opens a large gap in a budget already strained by the construction of an expensive and relatively unnecessary highway (this controversial tender was won by US's Bechtel, in consortium with a smaller Turkish company; the contract, unusually negotiated after the tender, uses a cost-plus formula which could push the final price well above current estimates, which exceed 20% of GDP: in Albania, the final price of a highway built by the same consortium with a similar contract was more than twice the initial estimate).

The European commission, the IMF and others sharply criticised the pay rise. Alone, the US defended it. With US support, and (astonishingly) the praise of the ICO's head, the government implemented it. In the following weeks the elite gladly allowed the US ambassador to micromanage the formation of a new government and the election of two consecutive presidents (one election was illegal).

It would be pointless to criticise these policies, or contrast them with President Obama's recent speeches on reform in the Middle East: Washington has little interest in Kosovo, except that of keeping it friendly, and acts accordingly. The problem, rather, is that the EU allowed itself to be sidelined and the ICO remained silent.

Under US influence, the ICO lately seems interested only in preserving the appearance of a multi-ethnic society; so that now the Serbian Orthodox monasteries (still under Nato protection) can buy their candles tax-free, but corruption grows, the economy stagnates and the elite is extending its influence across Kosovo's institutions, economy and society, in what looks increasingly like a form of state capture. The ICO's silent presence is damaging Kosovo: it should either act or leave.

The ICO failed also as an experiment of a joint EU/US mission, and rather became yet another example of how the US used Balkan crises to assert and strengthen its influence over Europe.

If a form of international supervision is foreseen for a possible post-Gaddafi Libya, this precedent ought to be borne in mind. The supervisor should be given a narrower mandate, focused on governance. Economic policy should be left to specialist institutions, with the supervisor lending them its muscle. And, crucially, the supervisor should be placed under the political guidance of powers that have influence and the incentive to make good use of it.

If faced by a fiscal crisis, Kosovo will ask to be bailed out by donors. This would reward irresponsibility, protect the government from accountability to its citizens and merely postpone the crisis. Regrettably, though, donors might oblige.







A British man has died in hospital after being attacked two weeks ago near his hotel in Portugal.

Ian Haggath, 50, from Dunston near Gateshead, was beaten up in Albufeira. He died from his injuries last Wednesday.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: "I can confirm the death of a British national in Faro on May 25. We are in touch with the family and we are providing consular assistance."

According to reports Haggath suffered serious head injuries after being attacked by four people. There is speculation that the same gang is responsible for attacking two other tourists last month, one of whom died.

The Daily Mirror said Darren Lackie, 22, a soldier from Fife, was found in the street with a head injury and died in April. A few days beforehand in the same area of Albufeira, David Hoban, 44, from Dublin, was stabbed but survived.











It has been hailed as the French diet that reportedly helped the Duchess of Cambridge squeeze into her royal wedding frock and enabled the singer Jennifer Lopez and the supermodel Gisele B¨¹ndchen to shift their pregnancy pounds.

The protein-rich Dukan diet, which has swept across Europe and the US, has become the weight-loss plan of choice for the rich and famous. They are attracted by the promise of losing up to 15kg (2 stone) in a few weeks by eating as much as they want, as long as it is mostly meat, fish and fat-free cheese.

Fans of the diet are also said to include mother-of-the-bride Carole Middleton and the opera singer Katherine Jenkins. Those who have slimmed to a shadow of their former selves on the diet will not have a word said against it, despite its draconian rules.

It may, however, all be too good to be true. Some have claimed that the diet, invented by the French nutritionist Dr Pierre Dukan, is not only ineffective but can damage dieters' health.

A survey of nearly 5,000 "Dukanians" found that 80% regained all the weight they had lost within three years, and experts who analysed the results of the survey claimed the diet was a public health risk.

Dr Boris Hansel, a metabolism and cardiovascular system specialist at the Piti¨¦-Salp¨ºtri¨¨re hospital, in Paris, said: "The diet is not a long-term success because it does not meet our body's needs.

"There are real risks ¡­ infertility, sleep apnoea, high blood pressure, type-two diabetes, liver disease or cardiovascular problems. Following this diet is not harmless; it could cause real health problems," he told Le Parisien newspaper.

"Our inquiry is preliminary and shows the need for a real scientific study. The Dukan diet has to be evaluated because it poses a public health problem."

Doctors claim Dukan's latest advice to pregnant women to follow his diet "as early as possible and throughout the pregnancy" put their unborn baby at risk.

Irene Margaritis, spokeswoman for the French food standards authority, said a pregnant woman who dieted risked slowing down the growth of her baby.

She criticised Dukan's recommendation that mothers-to-be eat plenty of oily fish, seafood (including crustaceans) and offal, which is rich in vitamin A, an excess of which can cause malformations.

Dukan, whose 20 books have been published in 14 languages and sold millions of copies around the world, is the biggest selling author in France. He rejected the criticism, saying his diet was normal and healthy, and helped those following it to avoid what he considered the real health risk: being fat.

"We doctors have weighed up the risks and the benefits. I consider that the real risk is an excess of weight and obesity. Every day there are people who die from this and I am trying to fight against it," he told Le Parisien.

He added: "If a mother is obese during her pregnancy she will have a child at risk of diabetes or being overweight."











Key business figures in Syria are aligning themselves with opposition groups before a conference in Turkey on Tuesday in a sign that Syria's traditionally pro-regime business elite may be beginning to break ranks with the government of President Bashar al-Assad.

About 300 opposition figures are expected to arrive in Antalya, southern Turkey, for the three-day Syrian Conference for Change, designed to establish dialogue between opposition groups with a view to establishing a transitional council.

However, as a bloody crackdown against anti-regime protests continued, with Syrian activists reporting troops had bombarded a town in the central province of Homs with artillery on Sunday, it is clear sharp divisions exist among the fledgling opposition.

Until now, the Syrian uprising has largely manifested itself at street level with support from activists abroad as disaffected and marginalised classes call for personal freedoms and an end to corruption and poverty at the hands of the elite.

Organised by the Egypt-based National Organisation for Human Rights, the Turkey conference is being privately funded by three Syrian businessmen ¨C Ali and Wassim Sanqar, brothers who are luxury car distributors based in Damascus, and Ammar Qurabi, chairman of the national organisation and UAE-based satellite channel Orient TV.

Orient TV's Damascus bureau was closed after a bid to forcefully buy out the channel by the president's cousin Rami Makhlouf, who is on the US sanctions list and controls an estimated 60% of the Syrian economy through stakes in various companies.

The Sanqar brothers also ran up against Makhlouf when a law was changed allowing him to acquire sole distribution rights for their company's lucrative Mercedes dealership.

The Sanqar brothers declined to comment on their role at the conference, but Ammar Abdulhamid, the exiled Syrian dissident and head of the Washington-based Tharwa Foundation, said the inclusion of business personalities was "a significant development".

"We have a number of other businessmen and entrepreneurs here. The business community is slowly coming around to realising the need to support the future of Syria," he said.

On the eve of the conference, divisions were apparent. Organisers admitted they were rushed. Others, while calling for unity, privately complained of inadequate planning and consultation. Kurdish groups are boycotting the conference.

In London, an exiled nephew of the president claimed the conference was a front for Islamist extremism. Ribal al-Assad, head of the London-based Organisation for Democracy and Change, announced he would hold an alternative conference based on "freedom, democracy and religious pluralism".

The son of Rifat al-Assad, who led the 1982 Hama massacre of up to 20,000 people following an uprising by the Muslim Brotherhood, has attracted the ire of dissidents after failing to acknowledge his father's role in the siege.

"I can assure you that none of these people represents the Syrian opposition," he said. "They are individuals that only represent themselves."

He said some former brotherhood members were posing as moderates.

Long suspected of holding political ambitions, Assad said his only personal role was to "play a small part in bringing freedom, democracy and human rights to my country".

A pro-democracy activist and organiser, Radwan Ziadeh from the National Initiative for Change, denied the claims, saying the conference represented both secular and moderate Islamic groups.

But he acknowledged the need for religious Syrian society to be present. "We know Syrian society is very conservative. Moderate Muslims must be present."

He said leadership alternatives in Syria had been repressed. "Everyone knows that the Syrian uprising is leaderless. We need to establish some sort of balance to move ahead.

"The intended outcome is for a united opposition established on the principles of greater co-ordination inside and outside Syria."

He stressed that although Turkey sanctioned the conference, no state representatives would be present but said that any party formed should seek assistance from the Arab League and other international organisations.

"We can divide the cake later on, for now the focus is on the humanitarian issue in putting pressure on regime that has killed over 1,100 people and detained more than 11,000."

Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, suffered a humiliating and politically ominous defeat in his home city of Milan on Monday when his party's choice for mayor, Letizia Moratti, was ousted in a runoff by a local leftwing lawyer, Giuliano Pisapia.

There was yet more bad news for the right in Naples where the candidate of the fiercely anti-Berlusconi Italy of Principles party, Luigi De Magistris, stormed home with more than 65% of the votes.

Berlusconi was defiant despite the results that some political adversaries said marked the beginning of the end of his ascendancy in Italy's public life.

"This time we didn't win, but we continue. I am a fighter. Any time I have lost, I tripled the effort," he told reporters in Romania, where he was on an official visit.

Milan was one of 90 towns and cities where runoffs were held after clear winners failed to emerge from the first round of voting on 15 and 16 May.

The contest there was by far the most important. Milan is the city from which Italy's flamboyant prime minister launched his political career, 17 years ago. It is also the city in which he is on trial for a range of alleged financial and sex-related offences. And, not least, it is the stronghold of his key allies in the populist, Islamophobic Northern League.

Federico Manda, a tram maintenance technician, was one of a steady stream of last-minute voters. He had voted for "a change in Milan", he said. "Berlusconi has monopolised this municipality, putting his men in everywhere, often in the wrong places."

Berlusconi tried to turn the ballot into a vote of confidence on his private life and his government. The results suggested that was a disastrous error of judgment.

After the first round, Moratti came in six percentage points behind her main rival. In the subsequent campaign, the prime minister and his Freedom People movement tried to make up lost ground with an overtly racist campaign directed at Pisapia's sympathy for Roma and Muslims.

Professor James Walston of the American University of Rome, said he feared Berlusconi's tactics could have a lasting impact on interracial and interfaith relations in Italy. "This type of language has been used by the prime minister, not some neo-fascist maniac on the fringes," he said. "It will be difficult to bring Italian political language back to acceptable European levels."

The left's victory was all the more remarkable, since its candidate was not the choice of the mainstream Democratic party but one whose past is tinged with radicalism. Pisapia, who once defended the Kurdish separatist leader Abdullah Ocalan, was elected to parliament in the 1990s as an independent on the slate of the hardline Communist Refoundation party.

His initial sponsor in the mayoral race was the Left, Ecology and Freedom party, which is led by the gay, formerly communist governor of Puglia, Nichi Vendola.











A confrontation between Greenpeace protesters and the Danish navy has escalated sharply after the campaigners occupied a drilling ship off Greenland.

The environment group was warned on Monday that two protesters who climbed on to the British-operated oil exploration vessel are in breach of an exclusion zone around a deep-water drilling site about 90 miles off Greenland's coast.

Danish navy vessels are constantly intercepting the Greenpeace protest ship, Esperanza, after the protesters evaded patrols and occupied a survival pod they attached onto the drilling ship Leiv Eiriksson on Sunday morning.

The semi-submersible vessel which arrived at its drilling site on Monday morning is in a 500-metre security zone which is out of bounds to unauthorised people. The Danish navy and Greenlandic police are considering legal action against Greenpeace, boarding the Esperanza and attempting to arrest the protesters.

The action is in protest at a second season of test drilling by the Scottish firm, Cairn Energy, off Greenland; last summer four Greenpeace climbers occupied another rig operated by Cairn Energy on an exposed and flimsier platform for about 30 hours before being forced to give up by severe weather.

Greenpeace has accused the Greenlandic government and Cairn Energy of jeopardising the fragile marine environment of the Arctic by drilling for oil. It claims the region is so risky, sensitive and remote that an oil spill would be disastrous, and extremely difficult to clean up.

Ben Ayliffe, a Greenpeace campaigner on board the Esperanza, warned that a disaster similar to last year's Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico would be catastrophic. After a storm off Greenland last week, he had seen "huge, huge icebergs just coming out of the fog". "It gives you an idea of the potential risks that Cairn faces up here."

Greenpeace believes Cairn Energy has only 14 vessels in the area able to react to a spill, compared to 6,500 vessels used after the Deepwater Horizon. The drilling company is also operating in iceberg-infested waters hit by extreme storms, and admits it could take 37 days to drill a relief well.

"It would be inconceivable that Cairn would be able mount anything like that response and they've studiously refused to publish any sort of emergency response plan," he said. "It's impossible to know what kind of response they would be able to deploy."

The Greenlandic government rejected Greenpeace's criticisms, and accused the environment group of opposing Greenland's democratic decision to explore for oil. It insists its safety standards are the most robust of any country, and based on stringent drilling regulations and emergency plans used by Norway.

J?rn Skov Nielsen, of Greenland's bureau of minerals and petroleum, said Greenpeace had been making "totally false" claims about its oil spill response plan. Despite the campaign group's allegations, significant parts of the response plan had been publicised.

"It's totally untrue that there's no evidence of a comprehensive oil spill response plan; the detail is known to all the authorities. The main elements of it are known to the public," he said.

He added that the government had a three-tier "oil spill response plan", which included emergency equipment on all drilling vessels, back-up vessels in Greenland's harbours and a "third tier" of support vessels and equipment provided by other countries.

Nielsen said some parts of the plan were confidential, particularly the location of emergency equipment, because, he claimed, Greenpeace, could try to "destabilise" the government's emergency planning.

"We don't want to publicise all these details to Greenpeace ¨C the kind of information where they could find emergency equipment ¨C because we think that there's a risk that they will try to destabilise the emergency plan. Because they have shown both this year and last year that they're willing to break the law," he said.

Greenland has issued 20 exploratory drilling licences and is to issue more next year to some of the world's largest oil companies, including Shell, ConocoPhillips, Statoil and Chevron. It is predicted there are billions of barrels of oil in its waters. Cairn, the first oil firm for more than a decade to begin test drilling, has yet to make a find.

Cairn said it "respects the right of individuals and organisations to express their views in a safe and peaceful manner" but would be worried by "any action that presents a risk to the safety of people and/or equipment".

Sources close to the operation said Greenland's safety measures are more exacting than those used in the Gulf of Mexico; Cairn is required to have a second drilling vessel on standby during all drilling operations. All icebergs within a 20-mile radius are tracked and removed, said one source.

Deep-water drilling has taken place within the Arctic for decades, including within winter ice fields, in countries such as Canada and Russia and in Norwegian waters.

He survived Auschwitz, Dachau and a Stalinist labour camp, fled to Britain after the Prague Spring of 1968 and in seven years was the head of one of Britain's most successful international construction groups, respected throughout the industry and beyond. The extraordinary life of Sir Frank Lampl, former chairman of Bovis Construction and president of Bovis Lend Lease, who has died aged 84, tracked the 20th-century travails of Eastern Europe more closely than a Hollywood biopic might dare. In the course of it, his determination and transparent humanity in one of the toughest of industries inspired those who knew him.

He was born into a cultured Jewish land-owning family near Brno in Czechoslovakia. His father, Otto, held a doctorate. But when he was 13, the Nazis occupied Czechoslovakia and Lampl was deported with his family, first to the Theresienstadt concentration camp and then to Auschwitz, where his mother died. By the end of the war he had been made a slave labourer in an underground BMW factory in Munich and transferred to Dachau, from where he was liberated in 1945.

The only survivor of his family, he returned to Brno and began agricultural studies, but the incoming communist regime labelled him a "bourgeois undesirable" and in 1950 he was sentenced to five years' hard labour in the gulag-like camps that served the uranium mines at J¨¢chymov, fuelling the Soviet drive for nuclear weapons. Lampl found himself working alongside convicted Nazis ¨C his closest workmate had arranged the disposal of property belonging to deported Jews.

In 1953 he was freed under an amnesty after Stalin's death, but told he could only work in mining or construction. Unsurprisingly he chose construction and worked as a site labourer for 18 months. Later he reflected that "that kind of experience is a great advantage, particularly in construction, because it helps you understand what motivates people. If you come through the ranks, you have a much better feel for what is happening on site. Now the world has changed."

Lampl became a site foreman and applied to study engineering at university, finally succeeding after being turned down for three years in a row, and rising to manage a construction company. But when Russian tanks ended the Prague Spring in 1968, he and his wife Blanka, whom he had married in 1948, packed a suitcase and travelled to Britain, ostensibly to visit their son, Tom, who was a student at Oxford.

They settled in Clapham, south-west London, and Lampl found work on a building site, improving his English in the pub at lunchtime. He soon became a site foreman and moved to Bovis Construction as a project manager. His first job was to manage construction of the Arndale Centre in Luton, which opened in 1972, and where his successful handling of subcontractors was noted. An early coup was winning the contract to rebuild the premises of Pergamon Press after a fire. Lampl had read news of the blaze and cold-called his compatriot Robert Maxwell, Pergamon's owner.

In 1975 he was asked to head the newly formed Bovis International Division. He built it into one of the top 10 construction companies in the world, targeting a worldwide spread. "Economic cycles are not the same. Anglo-American companies have a different cycle to the east. By the time I retired we had a presence in 40 countries."

Landmark projects included Euro Disney, near Paris; Broadgate, in the City of London; Canary Wharf, east London; the Atlanta Olympic Games and the Petronas Towers in Malaysia, at the time of their construction the highest buildings in the world. Lampl travelled widely to clinch contracts and also harnessed the new American expertise in construction management through the purchase of two US companies, which his industry peers saw as a turning point.

In 1985, he was appointed chairman of Bovis Construction and a member of the board of P&O, which owned Bovis. He was knighted in 1990. In 1999 he negotiated the sale of Bovis to the Australian company Lend Lease, remaining life president until his death.

Lampl was widely respected in the industry for his principles as well as his achievements. He stressed the importance of reputation: "Maintaining a good reputation doesn't mean you have to be naive. Obviously a chief executive's duties are focused on enhancing shareholder value, but the reality is more complicated. You have to strike a balance between the interests of clients, shareholders, employees and the community."

He said he would like to be remembered for fairness and caring. "The expansion will remain linked to my name, but that's not the most important thing for me. Executives must be capable and competent, but beyond that they should be caring and fair." From 1994 to 2000 he served as first chancellor of Kingston University. He was a founding member of the Israel-Britain Business Council.

Lampl enjoyed reading, opera and travelling. He maintained Czech links and took particular delight in the return of his family's old landholding in the post-communist era. In 1990, he had visited his old construction firm in Moravia, remarking wryly that it had changed little since he had left it. By contrast, he had established a project office for Bovis in Brno. But he resisted approaches to write his life story, saying it was too horrible to relive, and took regular medication to ward off nightmares of being back in the camps.

Blanka predeceased him in 2001. He is survived by his second wife, Wenda, whom he married in 2002, and Tom.

Russia will spend $285bn (¡ê173bn) over the next decade to double the rate of road building, prime minister Vladimir Putin said on Monday, addressing one of the most sensitive issues for Russian voters.

Putin, who hinted he may contest the presidential election in March 2012, is keen to appease car owners. Opinion polls suggest Russians are increasingly concerned about road quality; the number of cars has doubled to 40m over the last decade. The figure is expected to reach 60m by 2020.

The World Bank said Russia's road infrastructure was restricting economic growth, with only a third of all roads meeting quality standards.

"The state of our roads is a real problem, constraining business activity, investment and development of the Russian territories," Putin told a local government meeting in Tver, a city 220km (136 miles) north-west of Moscow.

"Our financial resources allow us to double road construction volumes in the next 10 years."

Data published by the World Bank shows spending on Russia's roads fell from 2.8% to 1.5% of GDP in 2009, compared with 3.5% spent by China.

During years of economic boom, the road construction industry has become one of the most corrupt in Russia and costs have soared.

"We need to eliminate factors which lead to artificial increases in cost and construction delays," Putin said.

Russia, ranked 124th in the World Economic Forum's road quality rating, has increased road construction spending by 40% to $25bn this year by using revenue from sources such as petrol excise duty and vehicle licensing.

In 2010, work was completed on a motorway that links European Russia to its far east.

In recent years, car owners have organised rallies to protest against corruption among traffic police and the violation of traffic rules by senior officials.









Angela Merkel has committed to shutting down all of the country's nuclear reactors by 2022, a task said by one minister to be as mammoth as the project to reunite East and West Germany in 1990.

Monday's announcement, prompted by Japan's nuclear disaster, will make Germany the first major industrialised nation to go nuclear-free in decades. It gives the country just over 10 years to find alternative sources for 23% of its energy.

The move, hammered out at a mammoth 14-hour overnight sitting at the Kanzleramt, came amid mass nationwide protests against nuclear power and at a low point for the chancellor's Christian Democratic party (CDU), support for which has crumbled at the ballot box in five regional elections this year.

Although the proposal was welcomed among the general population, who have long been opposed to nuclear power, it was a move derided by one of Merkel's own MPs as "knee-jerk politics".

The plan is to keep shut eight reactors which were suspended in March in the immediate aftermath of the Fukushima disaster, and to close the rest by 2022.

The phase-out must be ratified in parliament and is likely to face strong opposition from utility companies. On Monday a spokesman for the energy giant RWE said that "all legal options" were on the table.

Last week, grid operators warned the phase-out could result in winter blackouts ¨C a prospect Merkel scoffed at . She insisted the decision would not lead to Germany simply importing nuclear power.

"We will generate our own electricity from other sources," the chancellor told a press conference in Berlin. She said the plans would give Germany a chance to be a "trailblazer" for renewable energy, suggesting it could eventually earn, rather than cost, the country money.

Energy firms warned that the decision ¨C a total policy reversal ¨C would require significant investment in energy infrastructure. Philipp R?sler, new head of the FDP party, which rules in coalition with the CDU, agreed, likening the task ahead to that which faced Germany in 1990 after reunification. A study in 2009 showed that €1.3 trillion (¡ê1.1tn) had been transferred from the West to rebuild the East.

This comparison was also made in an editorial by the left-leaning Tageszeitung newspaper on Monday, which said Merkel's decision was "historic" and "a moment like the fall of the Berlin Wall".

The government's vocabulary seemed to consciously echo the reunification process, with Merkel heralding an "Energie-Wende" ¨C "die Wende" is the word for change which became shorthand for the fall of communism and reunification.

Die Welt, a conservative daily, said the policy U-turn demonstrated a "creeping rejection of the economic model which has transformed Germany into one of the richest countries in the world".

The French poured scorn on Germany's decision. "Germany will be even more dependent on fossil fuels and imports and its electricity will be more expensive and polluting," said the French industry minister, ¨¦ric Besson. German households pay twice as much for power than homes in France, where 80% of electricity comes from atomic plants, he said.

Germany last year was a net exporter of power to France, according to data from the French grid operator, RTE. This trend was reversed last month after the accident at Fukushima and Merkel's decision to halt Germany's oldest reactors.

"Germany's energy policy will only work if there are improvements at the same time," the EU energy commissioner, G¨¹nther Oettinger, said on Monday.

He said there was a need for better grid infrastructure, storage capacity and forward planning as well as a more pronounced rise in renewable supply.

Germany plans to cut electricity usage by 10% and double the share of renewable energy to 25% by 2020.

Merkel first mooted an accelerated exit from nuclear power within days of the Fukushima meltdown, ordering a three-month "moratorium" during which nuclear power could be debated.

It was a remarkable U-turn. In September 2010, she had committed to extending the lives of Germany's 17 nuclear plants.

Many of her party are unhappy with her handling of the situation.

"Knee-jerk politics like the reaction to Fukushima does not pay dividends," said Mike Mohring, the head of the CDU faction in the Thuringian state parliament, last week.

Among other G8 nations, only Italy has abandoned nuclear power.

Protestors bang pots and pans in front of the Greek Parliament in Constitution Square, Athens to protest against austerity measures. Photograph: Matt Cardy/Getty Images
The banner flapped in the wind for almost a week surviving the rigours of sun and sudden downpour. But as thousands of Greeks last night flooded into Constitution Square, Athens' main meeting point, protest ground and central piazza, the fading slogan summed up the mood of the nation at the centre of Europe's debt crisis.

"We want our life, we want our happiness, we want our dignity," it declared. "So out with the thieves and out with the IMF." A year after it was forced to accept the biggest bailout in western history a new and fearless spirit is stalking Greece, clogging its city centres, bringing traffic to a standstill and putting authorities on alert.

In Athens, the spirit takes hold just before the sun has set. It is then that Greeks, young and old, married and single, employed and unemployed flood the square in a wave of protest against the austerity and recession that has brought their country to the brink of despondency and despair.

"Openly we say that we have been inspired by the demonstrators in Spain," said Simos Adamopoulos, an organiser who has spent three nights sleeping in a tent in the square.

"Our motto is 'the battle that is never waged is never won.' We will stay here, and in squares up and down the country for as long as it takes."

While even protestors admit their endgame remains unclear, their motivation beyond the realms of party or political creed has surprised even the most cynical. As in Spain the demonstrators ¨C estimated in Athens alone to have exceeded 50,000 on Sunday ¨C have been lured into action by Facebook. Motivated by a peaceful desire to vent their spleen, they have turned up at rallies with pots and pans rather than the more lethal Molotov cocktail preferred by violence-prone youngsters.

"But," says Adamopoulos, "we're also really disgusted with the system, with the political establishment, with all those crooks and thieves. As we've got poorer they've got richer and that you could say is also spurring us."

Last night, on the sixth day of protest, the smouldering rage looked poised to intensify as Greece's international creditors applied pressure to it's squabbling political leaders to come to consensus over the need for yet more belt-tightening measures.

"If consensus is possible in Portugal and Ireland, how come it is not in Greece," asked Olli Rehn, the European Commissioner for Economic Affairs. "This is not a matter of political games but national destiny."

Political agreement over additional spending cuts ¨C and what will amount to one of the biggest ever privatisation programmes ¨C is now seen as key to the EU and IMF throwing Athens a second financial lifeline.

On Monday, the main opposition conservative leader Antonis Samaras reiterated he would refuse to throw his weight behind the "memorandum" ¨C outlining the terms of the bailout ¨C until taxes were drastically reduced to kick start the recession-hit economy and spur growth.

Barely 12 months after securing €110bn worth of emergency loans to prop-up its cash-strapped economy, Athens recently accepted that it will be unable to return to capital markets to service its borrowing needs ¨C a condition of the original rescue package ¨C any time soon. Greeks face an estimated €60bn in maturing debt in 2012 and 2013.

This week EU and IMF officials, inspecting the country's public finances, are expected to deliver an excoriating verdict on its inability to meet budget deficit targets and bring the money-sapping public sector under control. Amid persistent speculation that Greece is headed for sovereign default, senior EU officials held unannounced emergency talks with the Greek government over the weekend.

Concerns over the looming credit crunch were heightened last week when the IMF warned that it would withhold the next instalment of aid ¨C due in June and at €12bn (¡ê10bn) crucial for payment of pensions and civil servants wages ¨C unless the EU guaranteed Athens' funding needs for the year ahead.

A new aid package, expected to be worth €65bn, was believed to be the focus of behind-the-scenes talks on Tuesday, with EU sources saying it could involve a mixture of collateralised loans from the EU and IMF, additional revenue measures and unprecedented outside supervision of Greece's privatisation process. A step that is bound to further stoke up tensions among the nation at the eye of the storm of Europe's worsening debt crisis.

This week EU and IMF officials, inspecting the country's public finances, are expected to deliver an excoriating verdict on its inability to meet budget deficit targets and bring the money-sapping public sector under control. Amid persistent speculation that Greece is headed for sovereign default, senior EU officials held unannounced emergency talks with the Greek government over the weekend.

Concerns over the looming credit crunch were heightened last week when the IMF warned that it would withhold the next instalment of aid ¨C due in June and at €12bn (¡ê10bn) crucial for payment of pensions and civil servants wages ¨C unless the EU guaranteed Athens' funding needs for the year ahead.

A new aid package, expected to be worth €65bn, was believed to be the focus of behind-the-scenes talks on Tuesday, with EU sources saying it could involve a mixture of collateralised loans from the EU and IMF, additional revenue measures and unprecedented outside supervision of Greece's privatisation process. A step that is bound to further stoke up tensions among the nation at the eye of the storm of Europe's worsening debt crisis.

Knights looking down from a castle provide a grand entrance to Malta's Playmobil theme park. Lifesize figures of a farmer and a pirate tower over children at the Playmobil farm where youngsters can ride pigs and a crocodile, "milk" a cow (it's only water) and ride narrow-waisted horses.

The original FunPark at the German toymaker's headquarters in Zirndorf in Bavaria is much bigger, but the Maltese version is popular. "There isn't much here [in Malta] for children," says Noel Zarb, a salesman at Playmobil Malta. He says local children come every day.

A 45-minute tour of the adjacent Playmobil factory (¡ê7 including FunPark entry), the company's second-largest, is also a highlight. Children discover how the seven parts of a 7.5cm Playmobil figure, with its ever-smiling face, are made from tiny plastic granules and put together to form princesses, pirates, police officers and secret agents.

In Malta, Playmobil makes 2m of the tiny precision-moulded figures every week ¨C five times the island state's total full-size population.

At a time when 80% of the world's toys are made in China, Playmobil has stubbornly resisted pressure to shift production to the far east. Helga Ellul, the head of Playmobil Malta, says the company looked at it eight years ago but found that the cost advantage was not that big, partly because its main export markets are in Europe. Since then, Chinese wages have risen.

Playmobil is also anxious to retain control over quality. The company's owner, Horst Brandst?tter, once told his workers: "If we wanted to produce in China, I would have to clone you all."

The toymaker only produces a few electronic parts in China, for example for the new Top Agents series and the flashing light atop its police car. Its Danish arch-rival Lego ¨C the top toy brand in Germany, which has relegated Playmobil to second place ¨C is also largely manufactured in Europe, although it has moved more production to the far east than Playmobil.

The plastic figures owe their existence to the 1970s oil crisis. The family-owned parent company, which started out making toy telephones and brought the hula hoop to Europe, asked its head designer, (then called 'sample maker') Hans Beck, to come up with a smaller toy to save on plastic. He sketched out a short figure with a smiling face, but dropped the nose after children told him it looked like a clown. Initially the legs could be moved separately, but he found that made the figure unstable and opted for legs that only move in tandem.

"At the time we only had big dolls and tin soldiers," recalls Ellul. "Mr Beck's idea was to create a small world for children, a replica of what they live in. None of us, not even Mr Brandst?tter, knew the power of this toy at that time."

The basic design has not changed since then and today's accessories are compatible with the original figures. Production started in Malta in 1974, where the unemployment rate was 20%, whereas Germany had close to full employment. Maltese wages were only a 10th of those in Germany (they have now risen to between a third and a half). The Maltese government lured foreign companies with tax breaks and paid for the building of the Playmobil factory. Today Playmobil employs 900 people in Malta ¨C the second-largest employer after ST Microelectronics.

The ever-expanding Playmobil world scores highly on gender equality - there are female firefighters, police officers and vets ¨C but does less well on multiculturalism ¨C there aren't many non-white characters.

It regards itself as a predominantly European brand. "It is very much a toy that appeals to the European culture," says Ellul. "We are in the US and Canada but feel it is much more difficult to get our message across."

Britain also falls into this camp: its children are seen as less keen on role-playing than those on the continent and regarded as having a shorter attention span. "Too many video games, children being left alone at home in front of the telly, both parents working," says the UK commercial director, Graham Brennan.

"There is a huge difference between the social sectors in the UK. In Europe it's more evenly paced. And French children love collecting." France is Playmobil's biggest export market.

Even though the UK is a small part of Playmobil ¨C it generated sales of just ¡ê20m last year out of a group total of €507m (¡ê439m) ¨C there are plans to open a theme park in the south-west within the next five years. "It's a question of when ¨C not if," says Brennan. Sometimes Playmobil is a little too close to life. Brennan recalls a barrage of complaints when Playmobil produced a female figure bottle-feeding a baby in a hospital. "People complained saying you are telling young girls not to breast-feed," he says. "I pointed out to them that it is just a toy."

Some 24,000 tonnes of plastic go into making Playmobil toys every year. Pellets of clear plastic are mixed with coloured granules, heated up and injected into moulds. The machines spit out 32 heads every 20 seconds, still hot. The eyes and mouth are injected from inside the face rather than printed on so they don't rub off. Some 46 km of overhead pipes ferry the plastic around the Maltese factory.

The whole process is automated, except for the bagging and boxing at the end, and takes about five minutes. One giant machine assembles the figures part by part ¨C a 'skeleton' holds everything together ¨C and cameras monitor every move. If a figure is found to have a part missing, it is despatched into a bin. More complex characters such as Santa Claus are assembled by hand.

Unlike other toymakers, Brandst?tter, 78, who wants to hand over the company to a foundation when he retires, has resisted TV or film tie-ins. Despite the success of Lego's Star Wars computer game, he is not interested in licensed toys, saying they get in the way of imaginative play. "Playmobil could easily do Harry Potter but licences are expensive," says Bernhard Hane, head of research and development.

But there are some signs that Playmobil, which has seen its target age group slipping from four to 10 to four to eight, is starting to move with the times. This year's Top Agents range, featuring a remote-controlled car with a video camera, is a nod to the popularity of hi-tech toys. But it's not all about gadgets. A Playmobil bestseller in the UK is the swimming pool with water slide. "The pool is selling exceptionally well. I think it's the guy with the Speedos!" says Brennan.











A British man has died after being attacked near his hotel in Portugal. Ian Haggath, 50, from Dunston near Gateshead, was beaten up in Albufeira two weeks ago and died from his injuries last Wednesday.

A Foreign Office spokeswoman said: "I can confirm the death of a British national in Faro on 25 May. We are in touch with the family and we are providing consular assistance."

According to reports, Mr Haggath suffered serious head injuries after being attacked by four people. There is speculation that the same gang are responsible for attacking two other tourists this year.











Personalised health tests that screen thousands of genes for versions that influence disease are inaccurate and offer little, if any, benefit to consumers, scientists claimed on Monday.

An investigation into the services found they gave wildly different results, and in some cases arrived at medical predictions that were no better than flipping a coin.

The findings of the Dutch study will bolster calls for tighter regulations around personalised genetics tests which can cost more than ¡ê500. Critics claim the tests are a waste of money that could mislead people about their future health.

According to the group at Erasmus University medical centre in Rotterdam, tests from rival companies predicted conflicting risks for some diseases, often because they disagreed on how common the conditions were in the general population.

Another flaw was that the tests looked only at genetic factors, whereas many diseases are governed more by lifestyle and other environmental factors.

In the study, researchers used a computer to simulate genetic information for 100,000 typical people. They then used formulas from two of the largest genetic testing companies, deCODEme and 23andMe, to predict the risk of eight medical conditions, including heart attack, prostate cancer, coeliac disease, an eye disease known as age-related macular degeneration and diabetes.

"When we looked at individual risk of disease, we saw enormous differences between the two companies," said Cecile Janssens, an epidemiologist who led the research.

"A major problem with these tests is that they don't take other factors into account, such as your age, diet, exercise and whether you smoke, which in most cases have a greater impact on disease risk.

"For complex diseases, if you ignore these non-genetic factors, you are looking at only a small part of the picture and missing the main story," she said.

While the companies used similar techniques to predict an individual's risk of disease, the test results differed in some cases by more than 50 percentage points.

A number of tests based on deCODEme risk models appeared to suggest the odds of developing five disorders, including age-related macular degeneration, were greater than 100%, a result that in itself raised concerns over the validity of the tests, the researchers will tell the European Human Genetics Conference in Amsterdam .

But Kari Stef¨¢nsson, the chief executive of deCODEme, said the Dutch team had misinterpreted the computer models their findings were based. "We never report a lifetime risk over 90%. This is not how we use these models."

Brian Naughton, founding scientist at 23andMe said: "We are aware that most people will be at low risk for most diseases ¨C this is what we expect, and is not an indication of inaccuracy.

"23andMe takes extensive measures to provide both accuracy and to highlight the context for relevance at all steps in the process of analyzing and presenting data. In addition, research undertaken by 23andMe seeks to expand relevant findings.
