CISG set up a whole part to regulate the passing of risk between the seller and the buyer, namely, from Article 66 to Article 70.
First of all, ¡°Passing of risk¡± according to Professor Schwenzer says in her book , is ¡°the point in time in the performance of the contract from which the buyer has to pay the purchase price although the goods might be lost or damage.¡±  Generally speaking, once the seller has performed his or her obligations in its entirety the buyer will have to pay the purchase price even if the goods are destroyed or are damaged.  That is to say, the buyer has to pay the corresponding payment for goods to the seller as soon as he has performed his obligation according the sale contract. However, Article 66 CISG makes a supplementary principle to the passing of risk which requires the buyer to undertake the consequence of loss and damage of goods after the risk had passed from the buyer by the method that buyer has to make the payment of full purchase price to the seller. However, the second sentence of Article 66 CISG prevents the buyer from paying the price under the circumstance that the goods are diminished due to the seller¡¯s conduct or omission.
Actually the concept of the passing of risk works as ¡°supplementary and gap-filling¡± function and is applied where the contract itself does not provide otherwise.  Both parties are free to contract with each other, and the terms in the contract also can be freely concluded. So there is a necessity to refer to the contract¡¯s content when talking about the passing of risk.
Article 66 CISG sets up the general rule for the passing of risk which is the buyer has to pay the full purchase price, after the risk has passed even if the goods get damages. It may be unfair for buyers to follow if the damages are resulted from the seller¡¯s acts or omission. Under this particular circumstance CISG makes an exemption for this general rule afterwards in the second sentence of Article 66 CISG which prevents the buyer from the payment obligation.
This provision seems to be too harsh at the first glance. However, it solves the sharp problem when there is an absence of the insurance when the damages to goods occur. However, to be more practical, the risk of loss will frequently determined by the contract. Both parties may use INCOTERMS such as FOB, CFR and C and F may specify the moment when the risk of loss passes from the seller to the buyer.  In that case, Article 6 CISG gives the privilege to the parties to exclude the application of this Convention but apply their own agreements.  And Article 67 CISG sets up the rule for contracts involve the carriage of goods. According to Article 67(1) CISG, the risk passes to the buyer when the goods are handed over to the carrier for transport to the buyers, which is confirmed by the court in CLOUT case No. 360.  The court held the buyer should bear the risk of damages of the goods after the seller handed thg goods to the first carriers. 
If there is an assigned place to hand over the goods, then the risk will not pass to the buyer until the goods have been handed over to the carrier at that place but not to the first carrier. However, to understand the meaning of handing over ¡°at a particular place¡±, emphasis should be laid on the place. Whether the seller itself or an independent carrier takes the transport obligation to the particular place, the risk will not pass until the goods has handed over at the place. 
With reference to Article 67(1), whether the risk has passed or not is irrelevant to which party gets the retention of the transport documents. However, if the seller transports the goods by its own employee, the risk that the goods are lost, destroyed or damaged stays with the seller. 
However, without identification to the contract, the goods¡¯ risk of loss will not pass to the buyer. This exception to Article 67(1) is indicated by Article 67(2).  The goods could be assigned to the contract by markings on the goods or the shipping documents.  If there is a consolidated carriage of goods to several buyers has been agreed on, or where this conforms with an international trade usage, the risk passes with the allocation and identification of the consolidated cargo. 
But in Article 79(1) and (2) CISG it concluded certain situations that after the risk has passed, the buyers are exempted to pay the purchase price damages claims due to a breach of contract if the failure of performance is due to an impediment beyond one¡¯s control and could not be reasonably foreseen or the failure is due to a third person. However this exemption does not give exemption to the passing of the risk. As Professor Schwenzer said in her book, ¡°A mere causal connection between the seller¡¯s acts or omissions and the loss or damage of the goods cannot by itself prevent the passing of the risk.¡± 
If the contract is fundamentally breached by the seller, the buyer can avoid the contract and therewith the risk passes back to the seller with the avoidance.  If the buyer manages to make the objection to the non-conformity good in a reasonable time, he could have avoided the contract otherwise the buyer has to pay the price even if the goods are lost. If the buyer is not able to avoid the contract, then the buyer has to pay the price even if the goods cannot be given back.  
Q3. As a general rule, when does the risk pass with regard to goods sold in transit? 
The first sentence of Article 68 CISG sets out the general rule for the determination of the passing of risk regarding to goods sold in transit, if the targeted goods have already in transit, the risk passes to the buyer when the sales contract is concluded, which is the general rule to refer to when dealing with the goods in transit. 
The second sentence of Article 68 gives an exception to the general rule indicated by the first sentence. It remains the determination of risk to the contract contents. In practice, the insurance is usually concluded into the contract, and Article 68 clarifies where the buyer could claim the loss to the insurer.
In the third sentence of Article 68, there is an exceptional situation which may lead the risks of loss and damage of the goods imposed on the seller is that if the seller acts in bad faith. The situation is the seller failed to disclose the goods had been lost or damaged which the seller knew or ought to have known. Seller¡¯s failure to make the disclosure will enable the buyers to seek every possible remedy for the damages of the goods according to Article 54 CISG. 
Q4. Why does Article 69 constitute a ¡®catch-all¡¯ provision to Articles 67 and 68 CISG? 
However, there is still blank area that Article 67 and 68 have not covered. So Article 69 makes the residual gap-filling rules. Article 69(1) rules when the risk to be passed to the buyer if the goods are handed over at the seller¡¯s premises. In that case, the buyer has to take the risk at the time the buyer takes over the goods or ought to take them over. However, if the buyer is not able to take the goods in due time, then a breach of contract will be deemed.
Article 69(1) will also to be applied when the buyer is ready to take over the goods, but refuses to pay the purchase price, or where it is excused from doing so under Art. 79 CISG. 
Article 69(2) concerns all the cases not covered by the pervious provisions that the passing of risk is bound to take over the goods at a place other than the seller¡¯s place of business. The necessity of this provision is to give a guideline to the practice. Practically, the seller and the buyer will often use INCOTERM or other delivery clauses in the contract that CISG could not possible to conclude every particular case into single provisions, without a principle, these situations will become gray area which may arose disputes. In my opinion, the most important usage of Article 69(2) is to prevent such chaos. 
However, if the buyer¡¯s failure to take the delivery is under the reasons of Article 79 CISG, the risk still passes to the buyer once the seller has placed the goods at the buyer¡¯s disposal and has notified the buyer thereof.  Likewise Artcle 67(3), Article 69(3) also requires the goods to be identified; otherwise the risk remains with the seller. 
In Oberlandesgericht Hamm (Germany),  a court made this judgment according to Article69 (2) and held that the risk that furniture stored in a warehouse would be lost had not passed to the buyer for the buyer failed to fulfill his responsibility to take the goods¡¯ delivery on due as was bound to the sales contract. 
Since the contract parties are freely to make agreements on delivery clause, it is insufficient for the goods to have been merely placed at buyer¡¯s place. If the INCOTERM is involved in contract, the premises to hand over the goods may be the seller¡¯s work, warehouses, or other third party¡¯s premises. The rational of Article 69 is that the risk should be borne by the party who has custody over the goods; that party will usually have insurance against loss of or damage to the goods.   Therefore, it is sufficient for the risk to pass to the buyer if he fails to take delivery and breach the contract under the contract, because the seller¡¯s insurance on goods may end with the fulfillment of seller¡¯s obligation.
