 In my mind, I have not been in this mood for a long time. First time in four year I have the self-fulfillment feeling. I schedule the days after getting the offer of internship. On Monday, Tuesday and Thursday I must get up at 6:00 AM to go to work. While the rest day of the first four days, which means the Wednesday, I should discuss the graduation project with my project advisor. Then, the other three days, I must complete this week's project assignment and also study the France language. Suddenly, I feel pressure first time in my college life. I can foresee the rest time at the last period of the college.
     Although, it will be busy in the rest time, I wish that these days will bring me unforgettable memory.











Personally speaking, I consider France a great country, with glory civilization just as China. What's more, I admire the pop star-Alizee and I like the movies of Sophie Marceau. I think that the French sound like song. For a long time, I have the dream one day I can speak French fluently and comprehend Sophie Marceau's movie without the subtitle. When this term began, I find out that I do not have review many books to prepare for the final examination. There is much for me to complete thing I like. The first idea came to my mind is that I can study French. I have bought two textbooks and grammar book to study all by myself. I believe the foundational experience in English will assist me to master this language faster than before. I have confidence in myself. May me good luck in the progress.










 In a fewer days, some of my classmates will go to the Nanjin Military to have treatment. Actually, this is the second time for my class to get together to have a diner. Although I have a lot of word to say, I can say nothing. I fall into the memory of the past three years we studied in the same class room. I do not want to apart from my friends. However, time just passes. We must find a suitable way for us to earn our lives. This is our life. Nothing can stop that from happening. What I can do is just get used to it and wish everybody in my class could have a bright future













So far, I have been intern in Trio for two days. The Trio which is a American company design and manufacture the machines which aimed at improve the efficiency of mine quarry. What's more, it also has the transmission belt machine. I am a intern in the research and development department. In this apartment, there are many brilliant and experienced engineers from whom I can learn a lot of knowledge and common sense in the mechanical area. Although, I have to wake up very early in the morning, I merit the opportunity that I can eventually work in a regular corporation. It takes me an hour and a half to get to the company to read my card. What's exciting is that the lunch in the company is much delicious than that in my school. Probably I have too much food in my school and this is alway these kinds of food cause the dislike of me on the food in school. All in all, I think this is great chance, I will take every opportunity in this company to improve myself on mechanical design.












Having been busy for six days, finally I can have a longtime sleep on the Sunday. In this week, many things excite me and make me think this week is meaningful and colorful. I have catch the last chance to go for the internship in the last semester in the college life. I experienced the busy in this crazy city. Every morning, I must get up at 6:00 and have only 15 minutes to wash my face and rinse my mouth. Then I ride my bike as quickly as I can to catch the latest bus which can drive me to the subway station. I eat my breakfast at the station. After a hour on the subway, I eventually get to the company and have my card read which marks the beginning of a busy day. While it makes me a little ease that I get got off at 4:30. Although It makes me very tired, I merit this chance because I consider it as an opportunity to improve myself.












In the past three and a half years, I have win a lot of honors, but this honor is what I have dreamed for a long time. After a vote for the Shanghai Excellent Graduate in my class, I finally got the honor. First of all, I should thank my classmates for the support without which I can not enjoy this honor. Beyond that, I should give my thanks to the dean of my college who cultivate me not only of the knowledge but also something concerning how to handle the relationship with my classmate. I will not let my supporter down and will keep on struggling and never give up. I think the future will witness my action on this promise. Yes, I can if I have confidence on myself.












This is really a exhausting day! I went to bed at nearly 1:00AM and woke up just after about 5 hours to go for the intern. Enjoy the internship life is harder to imagine than to practice. It is true I can experience a different kind of life and enlarge my vision of Mechanical Engineering. However, lack of sleep really kill me. 
     This morning I came across with one of my classmates and he asked me why I went for the intern. He thought I can enjoy a leisure time if I gave up. Since I have been recommended for the Zhejiang Uni and I need not to apply for job and also do not have to take the undergraduate entrance examination. It is true I will have a lot of best time for entertainment. But I chose to give up this instead of the intern. I think every hardship is just my own choice and have no one to blame.
     All above is just grievance I want to express in English. May the grammar is right and my internship is successful!
