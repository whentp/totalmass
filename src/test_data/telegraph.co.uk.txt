Researchers said there was little evidence that the arrangements had reduced hospital admissions for all conditions or led to more ill patients being brought in for treatment.
Instead, the system was seen as a ※tick-box§ exercise that did not encourage doctors to look at the health of the wider community.
As it rewarded GP practices that were well-managed to begin with, The King＊s Fund study claimed it meant ※the NHS has paid a princely sum for activity that was already taking place§.
Anna Dixon, director of policy at the health think-tank, said: ※A great deal of money has been invested in providing GPs with financial incentives through the Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF). It is disappointing that we have not gained greater return on investment so far in terms of health improvement in deprived areas.§
Under the system, brought in by Labour in 2004, GP practices are rewarded financially for meeting a series of targets on managing long-term conditions such as diabetes; providing extra services such as maternity care; allowing patients to give their views; and improving their organisational skills.
Practices achieved more than 90 per cent of QOF points in the first year alone, at a cost of more than ㏒1billion, and as a result the average partner saw their income raise from ㏒72,000 in 2002-03 to ㏒113,000 in 2005-06.
The King＊s Fund studied surgeries and Primary Care Trusts, the management tier above them in the NHS, across four areas of England to see if the system improved the health of the general population or helped deprived communities.
Researchers found only ※limited incentives§ to improve public health or disease prevention, and that GP leadership and values had more effect than the bonuses.
They said the QOF promoted a ※medicalised§ and ※mechanistic§ view of treating patients rather than looking at the whole population.
Although high-performing practices were linked to lower hospital admissions for patients with heart disease, there was no link to those with asthma or stroke.
Practices in poor areas were ※passive and opportunistic§ when it came to finding all cases of disease nearby.
Because of the way the targets are monitored, ※the QOF appears to reward practices that have more resources and are therefore more organised, better able to attract and retain good staff, and able to focus on maximizing their QOF scores§.
The report calls for QOF to be revised, including a greater focus on population outcomes such as reductions in rates of emergency admissions to hospital.
Dr Laurence Buckman, chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs Committee, said: ※Preventative care, such as advising on the importance of healthy eating, has always been central to what GPs do, but it has not been included in the QOF, in part because it is very difficult to measure the impact of giving advice.§
Paul Burstow, the health minister, said: ※This is further evidence for why we need to modernise the NHS.
※We agree that the QOF needs to focus more on improving people's health, including more effective incentives on primary prevention and public health. We are taking steps to do this.§











Most hospital consultants currently receive an annual merit award, which gives them up to ㏒76,000 on top of an average salary of ㏒110,000.
Once a medic is on the scheme, they almost always stay on it for life, with the fund counting towards their pension.
In August, Health Secretary Andrew Lansley ordered an overhaul of the whole system, which has just paid more than 1,700 doctors more than ㏒45,000 each, on top of their salaries.
Now medics have been told that until this review reports, the fund for all new payments made by local hospitals will be cut by more than 40 per cent. Meanwhile, the number of new awards made by the national part of the scheme has been halved.
While maximum levels remain the same 每 at ㏒76,000 for those who get a payout from the Department of Health, and ㏒35,000 for those rewarded by their local hospital, the pot will be shared among fewer medics.

New figures show that this year, 300 consultants received a "platinum" award of ㏒75,800 in bonuses. Another 623 took home "gold" rewards of more than ㏒55,000, and 847 were given more than ㏒46,000.
Consultants have been given rewards above basic salary ever since the NHS was created in 1948.
But they have become more contentious since a new contract, introduced in 2003, increased the average salary by one third, to ㏒110,000, as working hours fell.
This year, more than half of consultants received some sort of merit payment, under schemes set up to reward those who have made outstanding contributions to patient care or research.
The British Medical Association is threatening to take legal action over the new cuts, which will take effect in April.
The chairman of its consultants committee, Dr Mark Porter, said ministers were sending out an "appalling" message to the NHS.
The union has written to Mr Lansley, objecting to the latest changes, and is exploring whether legal action can be pursued.
Dr Porter told The Sunday Telegraph: "This is a really appalling way to treat doctors.
"We understand that there is a difficult position with public spending, but to specifically hit out at those doctors who are performing at the highest levels 每 those who go the extra mile 每 and decide to take investment from them, sends out a terrible message."
Alan Maynard, Professor of Health Policy at York University said the Government was right to attempt to clamp down on a scheme which he described as "extraordinarily generous and poorly policed".
He said: "These payments are supposed to reward particular excellence, and supposed to be subject to regular review.
"In fact, once an award is made, it is almost always for life, and these sums augment doctors' pensions by an enormous amount."
Emma Boon, from the TaxPayers' Alliance, said that while consultants did an important job, the increases to their incomes in the last decade had been "astonishing".
She said: "We need to ensure value throughout the NHS, and that means we can't afford to sustain payments at these levels. Though doctors deserve decent rewards, we should be careful not to overcompensate them for the work they do."
The Department of Health said the changes reflected the "challenging financial environment" the NHS was working in.
A spokesman said the Government wanted to reward those who went beyond the call of duty, and said the best consultants would still receive awards.












Under plans unveiled in Lord Hutton's landmark report, six million workers will have to retire later and pay more for a less generous scheme.
Unions and trade bodies in virtually every service immediately responded with anger to the proposals, most of which are likely to be adopted by the Government.
But Ms Altmann, now director-general of Saga, said: "Lord Hutton's recommendations on public sector pensions have led to calls for industrial action by public sector unions, but the reality is that his proposals will still leave them with hugely generous pensions that most private sector workers could never hope to achieve.
"Lord Hutton has left most of the difficult decisions about pension funding to the Government and has made broad headline recommendations with details to be filled in by the Treasury in negotiation with the unions."
After the report was published, unions immediately raised the prospect of coordinated strikes by NHS staff, civil servants, teachers and other key public sector workers.

Brian Strutton, national officer of the GMB union, said "Lord Hutton had a real chance to make sure low paid public sector workers have good quality, affordable pension schemes, but in failing to address the key issue of affordability to members, that chance has been wasted.
"Many of his conclusions are questionable and will infuriate public sector workers. It's not cogent enough to be a blueprint for reform but it might well light the blue touch paper for industrial action."
Jon Skewes of the Royal College of Midwives added that members would be "appalled" by the Government's "attack" on their pensions.
"On top of pay freezes, cuts to services and threats to the NHS itself, this will be seen as a slap in the face for hard-pressed midwives and maternity support workers,§ he said.
※They will react with anger and dismay and many may vote with their feet and leave the NHS. This will only serve to exacerbate the current and critical shortage of midwives and have a negative effect on the care women and babies receive."
Bob Crow, of the RMT union, said the report would be "the spark that lights the blue touch paper of coordinated strike action".
He added: "It is crystal clear from the Hutton Review that, from nurses to transport staff, the Government intend to make staff work longer, pay more and get less.
※There is no question that this is the issue where coordinated strike action is on the cards as we fight to stop the ConDem pensions robbery."
And Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC, said: "Public sector workers are already suffering a wage freeze, job losses and high inflation.
※They are now desperately worried that they will no longer be able to afford their pension contributions, and will have to opt out.§
But as he launched his report, Lord Hutton argued that replacing final salary pension schemes with career average pensions would benefit lower paid workers and said his aim was to make the system fairer.
By 2015, he said that most employees should expect to retire at state pension age, which is due to rise to 66 in 2020. Those working in the uniformed services would be able to draw their pension from their 60th birthday.
Warning that the current system was no longer sustainable for the taxpayer, he told Radio 4＊s Today Programme: "If we go on as we are, we are heading for the rocks.
"The solution is not a race to the bottom, nor to hack away at public sector pensions. The biggest risk is the rapidly rising life expectancy."
Lord Hutton said it will take several years to implement the suggested reforms, which will require legislation, so the nearer workers are to retirement, the less they will be affected.
But the former Labour minister said it was an "inescapable reality" that people will have to work longer, with the retirement age rising to 68 within the next 30 years.















The lay members of the bodies would play a crucial role in overseeing doctors who are to be given control over commissioning care for patients under the NHS proposals. NHS managers currently oversee doctors.
The recommendation 〞 intended to answer criticism that the new GP-led bodies were unaccountable and at risk of conflicts of interest 〞 is expected to be one of a number made by a panel of experts reviewing the Government＊s health legislation after David Cameron ordered a ※pause§ amid public concern over the scheme.
The Liberal Democrats are campaigning for many parts of the reforms to be abandoned or watered down.
Nick Clegg, the deputy Prime Minister, has demanded that Monitor, a new economic watchdog for the NHS, should promote collaboration rather than competition.
His party has also called for locally-elected councillors to sit on medical bodies but this proposal looks likely to be vetoed in favour of members of the public playing a role.

But Mr Clegg＊s team are thought to have successfully delayed the implementation of the legislation 〞 with MPs now unlikely to even vote on the revised plans until the autumn.
The ※Future Forum§ of medics, academics, charity bosses, council leaders and health care managers was asked to consider amendments to the legislation amid fears it heralded the backdoor privatisation of the NHS. The 44-strong panel was due to write to the Prime Minister ※by the end of May§ but submissions are still being made.
Jeremy Taylor, a member of the Future Forum who is chief executive of the charity National Voices, said: ※The original timescale was that we would be producing our report by the end of May but I have to say we haven＊t written it yet. There＊s been a renegotiation of the deadline.§
Last week, asked when he thought the report would be submitted, Sir Stephen Budd, who is writing the section on choice and competition, replied: ※I think the week after next but frankly it＊s a moveable feast.§
David Kerr, a Professor of Cancer Medicine at the University of Oxford who has written a piece for the Telegraph on how the reforms can improve health, said the forum had yet to make a difficult decision on whether or not strict Department of Health deadlines for the introduction of the new regime should be relaxed.
※It was a question that was raised repeatedly, we can't duck it,§ he said.
The Health And Social Care Bill proposed abolishing two tiers of management and handing control of ㏒60?billion to purchase treatment to new GP-led bodies, who would be free to send patients to private firms as well as local state-run hospitals.
The plans have been attacked by the British Medical Association and other professional bodies. The Prime Minister＊s office has now effectively taken control of the legislation and is thought to be privately negotiating details of a revised plan with the Liberal Democrats.
Yesterday, bookmakers installed Andrew Lansley, the Health Secretary, as the favourite to leave the Cabinet in the coming months. A lipreader claimed Mr Cameron told Mr Clegg the Bill now had ※nothing to do§ with Mr Lansley when the pair were talking in public last week.
A Downing Street spokesman insisted that Mr Cameron still had full confidence in Mr Lansley. ※The speculation in the papers is nonsense. Andrew Lansley is doing an excellent job.§










The latest retirement survey found 27 per cent of over 50s do not know what age they will be when they finally stop working, up from 10 per cent last year and the highest level since records began in 2008.
It also suggested 17 per cent of over 50s do not want to work past the age of 65, but may be forced into earning an income due to a lack of a sufficient pension pot.
The financial pressures they face are too great for them to retire, particularly for a third of this group who are still giving their children handouts.
The annual State of Retirement Report from insurer LV= found a drop in long term savings during the past 12 months of ㏒342 a month or ㏒4,104 a year.
It suggests retirees are placing a higher importance on dealing with more immediate financial strains rather than considering the longer term.
Ray Chinn, head of pensions at LV=, said: ※The Coalition Government has proposed and made a significant amount of changes to our pensions＊ system which is yet to register with many people in or nearing retirement.
※It is clear that many of the changes, such as the removal of compulsory annuitization and a flat rate state pension, are gathering support from the over-50s. Despite these changes, there is still no indication that any will act as an incentive to get people saving, and saving more, for their retirement years.
※In fact, our report has found quite the opposite, as a significant number are still cutting back on what they save each month and by a greater sum as time goes by.§











The largest number of "pension millionaires" is found in the National Health Service, which has 22,999, according to figures released under the Freedom of Information Act.
Other public sector pension millionaires include 3,680 former civil servants and 2,658 teachers.
Almost 400 retired staff from Glasgow city council and 223 from Kent county council also have pension pots worth ㏒1m or more.
The ㏒1m assessment was based on analysis by Terry Arthur, a fellow of the Institute of Actuaries, who found it would cost ㏒1m on the open market to buy a pension of ㏒33,000 a year, net of lump sum.
The Freedom of Information request by a Sunday newspaper asked the pension trustees of almost 1,000 public sector pension schemes how many retired members were being paid more than ㏒33,000 per year, net of lump sum.
Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has a pension now worth ㏒5.4m, the largest in the public sector.
He is among more than 20 civil servants and quango heads who have accumulated pensions worth ㏒2m or more.
Three BBC board directors also feature in the top five.
John Smith, who heads BBC Worldwide, the corporation's commercial arm, has accumulated a ㏒3.1m pension pot after 18 years' service.
The cost of providing public sector pensions usually far exceeds their contributions, with civil servants paying 3.5 per cent of their salaries while police contribute nine per cent.
Final salary schemes remain common in the public sector while 80 per cent of such schemes in the private sector have been closed to new entrants.
The pension figures for almost 1,000 NHS trusts, councils, quangos and Whitehall departments also show that large numbers of staff are taking early retirement.
More than 83 per cent of council workers in Manchester, Bath and Nottingham who retired last year did so early.
But councils in Dorset, Richmond and Wandsworth had equivalent rates of less than 10 per cent.
The average retirement age at councils in Glasgow and Swansea was 56.
Ros Altmann, a former adviser on pensions to Tony Blair, said: "The number in the public sector will rise in the years ahead, not least because pay levels have risen sharply in the public sector in recent years.
"The burden of paying these very generous pensions will fall on taxpayers for generations to come."
The Treasury said the pensions of state workers were "fully costed and fully affordable" and were an integral part of attracting high-quality staff to the public sector.









New figures have disclosed that some health service chief executives will retire with annual gold-plated payouts worth up to ㏒110,000 despite the system currently under severe financial strain.
The revelations, which compare to the annual pension of just ㏒7000 for an average NHS worker, come as many private pension schemes are falling.
Separate statistics also show that more than 2600 senior managers of hospitals and health trusts are paid ㏒250,000 a year 每 ㏒107,500 more than the salary paid to David Cameron, the Prime Minister.
It also comes amid heavy cutbacks throughout the NHS as frontline services are hit by budget cuts. PE
According to the new figures, the chief executives of ten strategic health authorities in England have gold-plated final salary pension pots worth between ㏒1.2million and almost ㏒2.6million.
The biggest belongs to Sir Neil McKay of the East of England authority, and is currently valued at ㏒2.59million, reports suggested.
He is currently paid between ㏒230,000 and ㏒235,000, and he is said to have earned an annual retirement of between ㏒105,000 and ㏒110,000.
Sir Ian Carruthers, from the South West strategic health authority, has an estimated pension pot valued at ㏒2.58 million.
He is expected to receive between ㏒100,000 and ㏒105,000 when he retires.
The chief executives, who were unavailable for comment, will contribute about 8.5 per cent of their salaries to their pension, with the he remainder coming from NHS budgets.
Last year, a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, the global accountancy firm, estimated that, on average, private sector workers would need to put 37pc of their salary into their pension to match the retirement income paid to a public sector worker on a similar wage.
The new figures come just weeks after the Department of Health disclosed lucrative bonuses paid to senior executives had doubled in five years.
Officials admitted that some executives earning six-figure salaries were paid an additional ㏒27,500.
Daniel Poulter, Conservative MP for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, said officials needed to ※curb this kind of excessive spending on management§.
※It is completely unacceptable that under Labour, senior NHS managers, some of whom were already paid salaries ten times more than hard-working nurses, received annual pay increases of around 7 per cent when front-line NHS staff received only 1.8 per cent,§ the former hospital doctor told the Daily Mail.
※The Government is investing ㏒11.5billion in the NHS over this parliament, but we urgently need to curb this kind of excessive spending on management.§
Strategic health authorities oversee the work of hospitals and primary care trusts in their area.
As part of the Government＊s controversial health reforms, they are due to be abolished.
The Daily Telegraph disclosed on Monday that patients and members of the public may sit on official bodies overseeing doctors and hospitals under revised plans to reorganise the NHS being drawn up by the Government.
The recommendation 〞 intended to answer criticism that the new GP-led bodies were unaccountable and at risk of conflicts of interest 〞 is expected to be one of a number made by a panel of experts reviewing the Government＊s health legislation after David Cameron ordered a ※pause§ amid public concern over the scheme.

The 65 year-old best selling author of the Teenage Health Freak books, died at home in Oxford at lunchtime on Saturday, surrounded by her family and close friends.
Friends disclosed family doctor of more than 30 years, died four years after being diagnosed with pancreatic cancer, one of the deadliest forms of the disease.
Despite gruelling surgery Dr McPherson, a mother of three who had five grandchildren, suffered a recurrence earlier this year and was told by doctors that she only had months to live.
While it remains unclear how she died, she has spoken of her wish to die at her own home rather than having to travel to a country where assisted suicide or euthanasia is legal.
The Daily Telegraph can disclose that in the days before she died, Dr McPherson wrote a letter to close friend Joe Collier, in which she wrote of her frustration at her failing health.
The doctor who really wants to listen 08 Apr 2010
"I really feel pretty bloody awful," she wrote.
"I can't understand why I have to carry on living like this - why can't I just die?
"I really feel furious at this. I think its cruel (to stay alive)."
On Monday night her family, friends and colleagues paid tribute to the family doctor, describing her as ※inspiring§ and ※courageous§.
They said she was a passionate supporter of assisted suicide, who used her own experience to campaign for a change in the law to allow terminally ill patients more control over their own death.
Beth Hale, one of the doctor's daughters, issued a family statement on behalf of her family, in which they paid tribute to a "truly wonderful wife, mum and granny".
"Her ability, apparently so effortless, to combine her professional life with her family life should provide inspiration to working women everywhere," they said.
"Many of her happiest times were spent relaxing with her family in the south of France or north Oxford and she was never short of fun ideas and activities for her beloved grandchildren."
It added: "Her death leaves a huge gap in many lives and her husband, three children and five grandchildren, with one on the way, can only hope in some way to do justice to her formidable spirit."
Last year she founded a new campaign group, Healthcare Professionals for Assisted Dying, to back the campaign for a change in the law. She is also patron of Dignity in Dying.
She also worked with Hugh Grant, the actor, to raise awareness of pancreatic cancer through the charity Healthtalkonline, where she was medical director and he was patron.
Earlier this month, the Hollywood star accepted the British Medical Journal's Communicator of the Year Award on her behalf, along with her husband Klim McPherson.
The Notting Hill and Love Actually star, who is patron of the charity healthtalkonline, led tributes on Monday night
"Ann was an amazing woman - doctor, author, campaigner and founder of the inspired healthtalkonline," he said.
"I am so delighted she nagged me into helping with it and I'm so sorry for her family, for medicine and for the country that she's gone."
Sarah Wootton, chief executive of Dignity in Dying, said Dr McPherson had left ※an incredible legacy§.
"The fact that she ＃ continued to work tirelessly on other projects close to her heart, all at the late stages of terminal cancer, is a testament to her strength and tenacity," she said.
Mr Collier, the acting chair of HPAD, which now has more than 400 members, added: ※We all knew she would die soon, and could not but be inspired by her courage, her drive, her selflessness and her unstinting leadership in her last years.§
After training St George's Medical School where, to the disappointment of her professors, declined the brilliant academic career that beckoned in favour of general practice.
Having moved to Oxford as a GP, she co-wrote The Diary of a Teenage Health Freak, the first health guide for adolescents, which sold more than a million copies in 27 languages and was made into a six-part television series.
She also established a supportive resource for patients to share their experiences with each other, the directory of patients＊ experiences (Dipex).
Ian McEwan, the Booker Prize-winning author, also became a patron of Dignity in Dying after Dr McPherson, his family doctor and lifelong friend, began her campaign to revise the 1961 Suicide Act.
In a video message played to the Royal Society of Medicine＊s conference on the ethics of assisted suicide last July, she said: ※I know recently a palliative care doctor has said that every suicide is a tragedy. I don＊t agree with that. I think that assisted dying for someone who is terminally ill may be a celebration, it shouldn＊t be seen as a tragedy.
※It maybe means that they have much better dignity in their death and their family can be there and they can plan it in a way that they can get all the support that they want.
※I don＊t want to go somewhere like Switzerland, to Dignitas, to be able to die with dignity. I want to have the option of being able to be in my own home, surrounded by my family and friends, if that＊s what I want and how it happens.§












Thousands of patients are being put at risk by homes that failed to adequately feed or clean their residents, according to the Care Quality Commission, the government regulator.
The disclosures come amid a growing financial crisis within the sector and claims that some private companies are providing worse standard of care.
Southern Cross, Britain＊s biggest care home company, which is in charge of 30,000 elderly residents, has until Wednesday to persuade its landlords to cut its rents or risk financial collapse.
Experts said the company＊s plight came from ※misguided property deals§ that was used to fund a rapid expansion programme.
The company has 31,000 ?residents in 750 homes and a warning of the disruption that could occur if ?Southern Cross collapses is the fate of Sefton Park Care Home in ?Lanarkshire, Scotland.
According to the Financial Times, the CCQ has the quality of care in one in seven privately run homes in England was rated ※poor§ or ※adequate§.
In contrast, the low ratings were applied to just one in 11 homes run by non-profit organisations or local authorities.
The findings were based on the latest available data from April last year.
Industry data has found the private sector generally paid lower wages on average than the non-profit and public sectors and has higher staff turnover rates.
The newspaper found that the CQC, which has itself been hit by its own financial constraints, had reduced inspections by almost three quarters in the six months to March this year compared with the previous six months.
※Fundamentally, it＊s now got to a point of being dangerous (for residents) 每 and it＊s going to get worse,§ one CQC inspector, who spoke on condition of anonymity, told the newspaper.
※If I had a relative who needed to go to a care service, I＊d be ?concerned.
※The cuts haven＊t begun to bit yet. When the next disaster happens, (inspectors) hope that it won＊t be one of theirs.§
A spokesman for the commission rejected criticism that it was ※unfit for purpose§.
※Our rise-based methodology is designed to enable us to spot warning signs that might indicate an emerging problem,§ a spokesman said.
※We would rather secure improvements to a care home than close it down, which can cause great distress to the people who live there and reduce the capacity in the local market.§
A spokesman for Southern Cross declined to comment.











Some are reducing bed numbers by more than 100, while also cutting headcounts to reduce their pay bills.
The Royal College of Nursing has claimed the moves risk affecting the quality of care - a claim rejected by the hospitals.
The trusts hope to make "efficiency savings" of 4.7 to 7.8 per cent of their budgets, The Daily Telegraph has found.
They have accelerated what are termed "cost improvement programmes" because the NHS is under pressure to meet total savings worth ㏒15 to ㏒20 billion by April 2015.
Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, responsible for five London hospitals, expects to cut up to 160 beds, or 10 per cent of the total, as part of a ㏒70 million savings drive.
An internal memo to staff reads: "In order to reduce costs, we will be reducing our bed numbers while doing our best to maintain the patient experience."
Claire Perry, its managing director, told them they had to make "unprecedented cost reductions" due to the "very challenging financial and political climate".
Neighbouring Barts and the London NHS Trust, which hopes to make savings worth ㏒42 million, expects to lose 100 beds over two years.
In northern England the picture is similar. Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust is to lose about 200 beds by next April, or 10 per cent of the total. It is looking to lose 700 posts by this October through 'vacancy control' - not replacing most staff who leave.
Central Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, which has five hospitals, will lose 80 beds as part of a ㏒42 million saving programme on a ㏒720 million budget (5.8 per cent).
If the situation is repeated across all of England's 171 acute trusts, thousands of hospital beds will go. As of April 2010, there were 100,867 acute hospital beds, according to the Department of Health.
Most of the savings will be made by reducing headcounts, mainly through limiting the use of agency and locum staff, rather than through redundancies.
Peter Carter, general secretary and chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said: "If some of these major teaching hospitals are saying that they can do without 150 or 200 beds, does that mean that they have been running very inefficiently in the past? I don't believe that.
"I don't believe that Barts, Imperial and others have been that inefficient that they can strip out that many beds and that many staff without affecting workload, efficiency and quality of care."
The long term trend is for less acute beds - the number has dropped by 8,000 since 1997 - with better ways of working enabling clinicians to reduce overnight stays.
But Mr Carter warned that taking out too many beds, too quickly, would be counterproductive.
He said: "We all want to see people discharged as quickly as possible, but if you force the pace, you are going to have more and more people coming back in again."
Staff would feel the effects of cuts keenly, he said, even though redundancies were being kept to a minimum.
Christina McAnea, head of health at Unison, said: "Cutting the number of staff will inevitably impact on patient care and cause greater stress for the staff left in post."
She added: ""The myth that the NHS is protected from cuts needs to be exposed."
Simon Burns, the Health Minister, said: "There is no excuse to cut back on services that patients depend on."
However, he went on: "It is for local Trusts to determine their specific needs on workforce and beds. We have made it clear that efficiency savings must not have an adverse impact on the quality and safety of patient care. "
"Reducing overnight bed numbers is consistent with medical advances which allow more people to be treated as day cases, when clinically appropriate."








The author, who faces a courtroom showdown with Jean-Michel Cohen on Tuesday, has also been criticised in a major study released on Monday that states his wildly popular four-stage diet is an ineffective health hazard.
Dr Dukan is the creator of a diet which has swept the globe and is used by celebrities from Katherine Jenkins to Gisele Bundchen. Kate Middleton's mother Carole said she used it to shape up for the Royal wedding.
The protein-based diet urges against counting calories, instead allowing dieters to eat as much as they like from a limited list of foodstuffs.
Dr Cohen's diet says readers can eat anything they like providing they stick to one of four calorie-based programmes of up 1,600 calories a day. The overall aim is to foster good eating habits and take regular exercise.
The case centres on an interview given by Dr Cohen to a French health magazine last year. In it, he argued that the Dukan diet messed up a slimmer's eating habits and "leads to serious health problems in some patients such as a strong rise in cholesterol, cardiovascular problems and breast cancer".
Asked who benefited from the DukanDiet, Dr Cohen said: "The slimming industry, doctors, pill salesmen, publishers, newspapers ... Everyone who has climbed on to the bandwagon of this fantasy."
Dr Dukan is suing Dr Cohen for libel. At stake is 15,000 euros (㏒13,000) in damages, but many millions of euros more in book royalties and profits from spin-offs.
More than 600,000 copies of the Dukan book Je ne sais pas maigrir (I don't know how to diet) were sold in France last year putting it in first place on the bestsellers list. The regime became a bestseller in Britain after its English-language launch a year ago.
Dr Dukan's lawyer Sebasti谷n Dufay said: "Dr Cohen has gone far beyond mere criticism."
Dr Cohen's lawyer, Richard Malka, says allegations of libel are "ridiculous and abusive". The medical community, he claims, is "unanimous in believing that the Dukan diet carries grave risks ... How can it be defamatory to say that diet programmes bring profits to those who publish them?"
Neither doctor is expected in court.
Dr Dukan's legal battle comes a day after a leading endocrinologist published a damning study of 5,000 Dukan dieters. It suggested that 80 per cent of people who followed his diet regained lost weight within three years. Dr Dukan claims the figure is 40 per cent.
His special diet for pregnant mothers was branded a "famine regime for babies" by Jean-Michel Lecerf, head of the nutrition service at the Institut Pasteur in Lille.
Both the Dukan and Cohen approaches 每 and 13 other diets 每 were criticised by a recent report by French nutrition watchdog, L'Agence de s谷curit谷 sanitaire de l'alimentation (Anses).
Dr Dukan hit back on Monday that his diet was "rigorously normal, healthy and (one) which avoids excessive weight gain".
"I consider the real risk is surplus weight or obesity. Every day people die from that and I contribute to fighting against it," he told Le Parisien.









Researchers have found that the stigma of being fat lingers with women long after they have shed the pounds.
But for men this is a positive thing as they see larger women as more friendly, approachable and emotionally stable than their thin counterparts
Women on the other hand - perhaps annoyed by the extra competition - view former overweight girls in a negative light - continuing to see them as undisciplined, emotionally unstable and even unhygienic.
The findings, which were presented at the European Congress on Obesity in Istanbul, emerged from a study by a team at the University of Liverpool led by Dr Jason Halford.
Dr Halford presented 106 young men and 96 women with a picture of a young attractive female accompanied by a short biography.
They were all identical except for the past history of weight control.
Roughly half the biographies showed the pictured woman had maintained the same weight all her life, while others said she used to weigh 16 stone and have a dress size of 24.
The participants were then asked to judge the woman on a Fat Phobia Scale, to evaluate what they thought of her.
Women volunteers continued to see the former fat woman in a negative light compared to other females - considering her undisciplined, lazy and unappealing, as well as grouchy and unhygienic.
But men saw her in a positive way considering her to be more friendly, approachable, clever and creative than her constantly thin counterparts.
Dr Halford said: "Some of the men quite liked the fact she had a weight history. They seemed to feel she was more approachable. She is not perfect. She is flawed.
※She is more likely to be friendly. Without the history of weight loss she is more likely to be unfriendly."
He said men also felt she was more creative and more emotionally stable than other women.
He said some men might have view her in a good light because they thought they would have more of a chance.
"One thing that might be interesting is it obese men who think that they might have a chance with her because she was once obese,§ he said.
Dr Halford, whose previous studies have shown that partners of fat people suffer discrimination by association, said that some women may not like a newly lithe competitor on the scene.
However, in practical terms the information could be useful for someone applying for a job.
He said: ※But the practical implication is would you want to disclose your weight history. Would you want to be honest about it.
※Would this work in a job interview situation with another woman judging that interview.§
"This cocks a snook at the idea that getting slimmer will solve all your problems. Their certainly seems to a taint and seems to be within women."












The high cost of a typical day out and parents＊ hectic work schedules mean families spend less time getting away from the daily routine than in the past.
A survey of 2,000 adults by researchers at YouGov found that 62% believed family day trips were less common today than 20 years ago.
The national charity, 4Children, which commissioned the survey, warned that costs and time pressures could be to blame.
The average day trip costs ㏒50 for a family, while previous research suggested that families typically spent just 49 minutes a day together 每 about five hours per week.
Anne Longfield, chief executive of 4Children, said day trips and holidays can help families stay together in difficult times.
※Hectic work schedules, financial concerns and competing demands on time can take their toll on the amount of time families spend together,§ she said.
※A day out offers parents and children a chance to get away from both internal stresses within the family and external pressures.
※A short break away from the domestic routine allows children and parents to reconnect, especially for those families experiencing tough times.
※Days out can strengthen bonds and build shared family experiences and memories that we know are so important in keeping families strong and together.§
The survey, conducted last week, found 12% of adults thought families went on more day outings together than 20 years ago, 16% thought there had not been much change, while 62% thought family days out were less common. One in 10 did not know.









An estimated 12,000 thousand applicants with straight A-grades fail to win places at Oxford and Cambridge every year. Some 3,500 top achievers are rejected by all of their chosen universities.
Under rules enforced by the last Labour government, vice-chancellors face heavy fines for exceeding their allotted quota of undergraduates, leaving many well qualified applicants disappointed.
But the Universities Minister, David Willetts, is said to be examining plans to open up recruitment at top institutions. A white paper expected next month will allow universities to admit as many candidates with the highest grades as they can attract, according to reports.
The move is aimed at encouraging universities to improve the quality of their teaching as they compete for the best students.
Under attempts to trigger a market in higher education, controls would also be relaxed on the recruitment of students to courses with fees of less than ㏒6,000 a year.
Most universities plan to charge ㏒9,000 next year for at least some courses and ministers are keen to see a more varied approach.
Vice-chancellors and college principals cautiously welcomed the proposal.
Steve Smith, president of Universities UK, the umbrella group for vice-chancellors, told The Sunday Times: ※It＊s not clear institutions feel secure enough to invest in expansion on a scale that would bring about the kinds of changes that the government might want to see.§
Paul Marshall, executive director of the 1994 Group of universities, said the system of controls was ※stagnant§ and needed to be relaxed.
Many institutions are reluctant to expand. Southampton, Surrey and Sussex are all planning to cut British undergraduates, while increasing those from outside the EU. Manchester plans to reduce numbers and Leeds may cut British undergraduates by 5%-10%.
Gareth Thomas, Labour＊s shadow universities minister, warned that the reform could create a ※two-tier system§ - one for students who are not put off by fees of ㏒9,000 and a second tier ※for those who are§.
A spokesman for the Department for Business, which oversees university policy, described the report as ※speculation§.











Lawrence Gonzi, the prime minister who campaigned against the introduction of divorce in the last European country apart from the Vatican City where it is illegal, said it was now up to the Maltese parliament to confirm the change to the law.
"This is not the result that I wished for, but the will of the people has to be respected and parliament should enact a law for the introduction of divorce," the conservative prime minister said.
With the final ballots still being counted, an estimated 54 per cent of voters had backed the change.
Malta is one of only two countries in the world - the Philippines is the other - that bans divorce. Chile was the last country to legalise divorce in 2004 after overwhelming public pressure.
Saturday's non-binding referendum asked the island's 306,000 mainly Catholic voters whether parliament should introduce a new law that would allow couples to obtain a divorce after four years of separation.
Legal separation is widespread in the European Union's smallest member state, but there are many legal obstacles to re-marrying.
"The yes vote has won and we urge parlementarians to vote a bill for the introduction of divorce," said Deborah Schembri, a lawyer who led the 'yes' campaign.
Arthur Galea Salomone, a spokesman for the anti-divorce campaign, admitted "the people's choice was clear, they opted for the introduction of divorce."
Divorce legislation is likely to squeeze through parliament as Mr Gonzi's ruling Nationalist Party has the slimmest of majorities - one seat - and analysts have said at least one of his MPs had backed the yes campaign.
The Roman Catholic Church, which looms large over the archipelago where 95 per cent of the population claim the faith, did not campaign officially in the referendum. However, Malta's Archbishop Paul Cremona had warned churchgoers in a letter they faces a choice between building and destroying family values.










The violent scenes flared after a peaceful protest turned ugly when members of the mob clashed with police trying to calm the situation on Saturday.
Police from all over the West Midlands were called to the Sikh Cultural Centre in Dudley in a bid to deal with the angry protesters thought to be from the UK Sangat - which protests against code breaking temples.
A police chopper had to be scrambled to monitor the violent scenes from above.
And one policeman was left with head injuries after protesters began pelting cops with bricks, bottles and missiles.
Protesters then forced their way in to the centre, barricaded themselves inside and trashed the centre - causing "significant" damage.
The tense five hour stand-off also left two demonstrators nursing head injuries and another policeman with dental injuries.
Protest organisers said last night: "All Sikhs should be aware of the basic Sikh tenets that meat and alcohol are not permissible in the Sikh faith.
"The centre owners have insulted the Sikh faith and violated Sikh Maryada by allowing a party to take place at the Sikh Cultural Centre."
The demonstration was organised after managers at the centre agreed to serve alcohol and meat at a private party set to take place that night.
But after practicing members of the Sikh community caught wind of the plans, a group gathered at the centre around 12.45pm on Saturday.
As the mobs numbers spiralled, some protesters picked up missiles and hurled them at police.
Specialist officers rushed to the scene to help negotiations between the militant Sikhs and besieged management staff.
And at one point a coach had to be given a police escort into the area - which had been cordoned-off - just to allow innocent centre users caught up in the stand-off to escape.
The violent stand-off only ended at around 6pm when managers at the centre caved in to the mobs demands and agreed to prohibit the sale of meat and alcohol.
Last night police said "significant" damage had been caused to the inside of the community centre, which remained cordoned off last night to allow forensic teams to examine the area.
Over five hours of CCTV footage has also been seized and will be trawled through in a bid to identify the ring leaders.
Chief Inspector Deb Doyle, who led the police response to the disorder, said: "What started as a peaceful protest soon turned to violence when a minority of people started throwing missiles at officers and then forced their way inside the centre.
"Once inside they have vandalised the building and refused to leave until the centre managers agreed to ban the supply of meat and alcohol on the premises.
"I would urge those responsible for the violence to hand themselves in to their local police station immediately or face officers arresting them at home in the very near future."
A 28-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of violent disorder but was released on police bail pending further enquiries.












The geneticist said that it was common in the Islamic world for men to marry their nieces and cousins.
He said that Bradford has a particular problem and warned that it could affect the health of children born into these marriages.
Prof Jones, who lectures at University College London, is likely to find himself at the centre of controversy in the wake of the comments.
Similar remarks made by Phil Woolas, a Labour environment minister, in 2008 resulted in calls for him to be sacked from the government.
Prof Jones, who writes for the Telegraph＊s science pages, told an audience at the Hay Festival: ※There may be some evidence that cousins marrying one another can be harmful.
※It is common in the Islamic world to marry your brother＊s daughter, which is actually closer than marrying your cousin.
※We should be concerned about that as there can be a lot of hidden genetic damage. Children are much more likely to get two copies of a damaged gene.§
He added: ※Bradford is very inbred. There is a huge amount of cousins marrying each other there.§ Research in Bradford has found that babies born to Pakistani women are twice as likely to die in their first year as babies born to white mothers, with genetic problems linked to inbreeding identified as a ※significant§ cause.
Studies have found that within the city, more than 70 per cent of marriages are between relations, with more than half involving first cousins.
Separate studies have found that while British Pakistanis make up three per cent of all births, they account for one in three British children born with genetic illnesses. Prof Jones also said that incest was more common than is often realised in every part of society, adding that it had been particular prevalent among royalty and suggested it is still -continuing.
※Royal families are the human equivalent of fruit flies because they do all the sexual experiments you can think of and there are some examples of inbreeding.
※Royalty did it to keep the heritage within the family line.
※Inbreeding doesn＊t apply particularly to our own royal family, but there is some.§
He explained that Prince Charles and Diana could both be traced back to Edward I, with Prince Charles being able to do this through 3,000 ※lines§ 每 overlapping connections between people in his family tree 每 and his former wife being able to do it through 4,000, making the Princess of Wales ※from stronger aristocratic heritage§ than her husband.
※Their parents had much ancestry in common,§ he said.
※We are all more incestuous than we realise.
※In Northern Ireland lots of people share the same surname which suggests a high level of inbreeding.
※There＊s a lot of surname diversity in London but if you look at the Outer Herbrides there are rather fewer surnames in relation to the number of people.§







Marine Sam Alexander MC, 28, and Lieutenant Ollie Augustin, 23, were killed by an improvised explosive device (IED) during a patrol in Nad-e Ali District of Helmand Province.
The servicemen, both from Juliet Company 42 Commando Royal Marines, were engaged in a mission to disrupt insurgent activity in the Loy Mandeh area at the time of the explosion, the Ministry of Defence said.
In 2009, Marine Alexander was awarded the Military Cross by the Queen for his bravery in charging down a group of insurgents to draw fire away from an injured colleague.
Having used all the ammunition in his machine gun, he continued his assault with his 9mm pistol until that too was empty 每 forcing the enemy to retreat.
The citation for his award said he carried out his brave actions "despite being completely exposed to heavy and accurate enemy fire".
Marine Alexander, from Hammersmith, west London, leaves behind his wife Claire and 10-month-old son Leo.
Paying tribute, Mrs Alexander said: ※He risked his safety for his friends but never batted an eyelid. It was his job and a job he did well.
※Sam was a loving husband and a wonderful father. He was our rock and my best friend. He has been taken from me all too soon.§
Lieutenant Colonel Ewen Murchison MBE, Commanding Officer 42 Commando Royal Marines, added: ※He was a truly remarkable young man.
※Decorated during his last tour of Afghanistan for gallantry, he embodied all the finest attributes of a Royal Marines Commando: he was courageous, selfless, resolute, loyal and cheerful in the face of adversity.§
Marine Alexander joined the Royal Marines in 2006 and first deployed to Afghanistan in 2009. He had recently trained as a heavy weapons specialist in anti-tank operations, before returning to Afghanistan on his second tour.
Lieut Augustin, from Kent, was on his first tour of Afghanistan, having only completed his officer training in December last year.
Superiors said it was a typical of his ※inspirational§ and ※selfless§ leadership that Lieut Augustin was spearheading the patrol when the bomb exploded.
Lt Col Murchison said: ※Despite only passing for duty a matter of months ago, he had already made a considerable impact.
"As a leader he was inspirational, passionate and selfless, putting the welfare of his men above all else 每 they adored him and looked to him for direction, but looked on him as a brother in arms.
※As a Marine he was utterly professional, dependable and tactically astute. At the time his life was tragically cut short he was characteristically leading from the front, taking the fight to the enemy; his audacity, commitment and courage clear for all to see.§
The former Dartford Grammar School pupil joined the Royal Marines in 2009 after spending a gap year undertaking charity work and travelling in Africa.
He is survived by his father Sean, his mother Jane, and his sister Sarah.
His parents said: ※Ollie was a much loved and cherished son. He was a beautiful boy who we were very proud of.
"His warmth and humour lit a room and infected all around him. He dealt with people in a thoughtful and compassionate way. His independence and sense of adventure meant that he embraced life and his chosen path.§










In the 1990s, when people thought that history had come to an end, the Foreign Office became obsessed with "diversity". It wished to widen the pool of recruits 每 more black faces, more women, fewer old school ties. The apparently paradoxical result was more uniformity of mind. Once you launch a cultural attack upon yourself, you disable independent thinking. Diplomats became embarrassed about their role, and more inclined to watch their backs. The past, of which Britain's foreign policy experience is uniquely deep, was forgotten.
Sherard Cowper-Coles never succumbed to any of this. He sees British diplomacy in historical, even romantic terms. Being a classicist, he has studied the Roman imperium; having an old-fashioned English education, he compares that empire to our own and to the American one that succeeded it. He also has an adventurous spirit.
So when the "end of history" itself ended in the ashes of the World Trade Center, Cowper-Coles's time had come. Britain found itself with an active role in the world crisis. After serving as Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, he was translated, in 2007, to Afghanistan, where our embassy became our biggest in the East. He was playing the 21st-century version of the Great Game.
I stayed with Cowper-Coles while he was in Kabul, and I can testify to his excitement at the drama, his pleasure in the ridiculous and his engagement with the issues. I can also testify, however, to his sense of frustration. One morning, having arranged for us to call on President Karzai, he went first to a separate meeting with him. When we met Cowper-Coles at the presidential palace after it, he was looking dishevelled with rage. Karzai had discovered that one of his warlord enemies was holed up in Kabul and had demanded that American and British forces help go in to capture or kill him. When Cowper-Coles and the US Ambassador refused, the Afghan president had succumbed to paranoid ravings.
This vivid book is chiefly an account of the author's frustration, not only with the mercurial Karzai, but with the entire Afghan situation.
Because Afghanistan is a problem shared between many nations and international institutions, Kabul is infested with non-Afghans. And because the security situation is so dangerous, it is natural for those non-Afghans to spend most of their time being driven in bullet-proof vests and helmets to meetings over breakfast, dinner, lunch and tea. The place is stuffed with the multifarious operatives of the "post-conflict stabilisation industry". You could work there for years without having any real idea about what any real Afghans think. Besides, the conditions are so arduous that tours of duty are short and leave (the author is scathing about the effect of "breather-breaks") generous. Before you have time to learn much, you go home.
In these trying circumstances, those involved, particularly the military, try to sustain themselves with an optimism not necessarily supported by the facts. As Cowper-Coles says, the mantra is "We are making progress, but challenges remain". He became more struck by the challenges than by the progress.
What renders the diplomatic comings and goings even more absurd is that the only Western power which truly matters is the US. America spends about $125 billion a year on Afghanistan. It loses more men than any of its allies.
So Britain finds itself, in Cowper-Coles's phrase, "lashed to the American chariot". It was far more important for our ambassador to cultivate the American one than to deal with Karzai. Eventually, Cowper-Coles became the British special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan. The real purpose of the post was to try to keep up with the US equivalent, Richard Holbrooke. Some of the author's best comic passages describe his efforts to engage Holbrooke's attention when the great man is thinking of his dentist, his BlackBerry or his dinner.
Cowper-Coles admires Holbrooke (who died last year) and dedicates the book to his memory. But one of his themes is that "Americans are just too democratic, and too nice, to be very good at ruling other people".
The Cowper-Coles thesis is that allied attempts to achieve an "Afghan lead" have not worked. He gives a striking example. One day, the then Foreign Secretary, David Miliband, asked a couple of Afghan ministers how long Afghan government authorities would stay on in Helmand after Western forces left. The expected answer was "decades" or even "forever". The actual answer was "Twenty-four hours".
The author advocates a "political solution", a politer way of saying a deal with the Taliban. Although he does not state this directly, my memory is that he pushed hard for the new Obama administration to reconsider America's unconditional support for the unreliable Karzai, as part of this solution. Instead, along came General Petraeus's surge 每 a bad example, in Cowper-Coles's view, of the military dominating the political.
In the end, Cowper-Coles's frankness and impatience worked against him. Less adventurous colleagues secured the top jobs he wanted. He left the service earlier this year, a disappointed man. He will probably have the satisfaction, however, of seeing the policy he advocated put into practice. With bin Laden dead and US and British elections needing to be won, "moderate" Taliban will no doubt be unearthed soon and bound in to some deal.
There are several morals drawn by the author from his story, all of them interesting; but the reader may add another one. If your son or daughter is a person of talent, courage and originality, don't let them go into the Foreign Office.









Marine Sam Alexander MC, 28, and Lieut Ollie Augustin, 23, were killed by an improvised explosive device during a patrol in Helmand Province.
On Sunday night, Marine Alexander＊s father, Stuart, a sports journalist with The Independent, questioned the role of the military in Afghanistan.
He pointed out there were conflicting ※public relations§ campaigns arguing that Britain and Nato were both winning the war and that there was no prospect of a military only victory.
※Is that a kind of facing both ways at once, the accusation so recently lodged against Pakistan by a finger-wagging David Cameron,§ he wrote.
※How motivating is it, if a stream of analysts say, this is an un-winnable war, pointing out that Afghanistan has witnessed more than 100 years of failed interventions.
※It is time the politicians were as professional as the men, including you (Sam), and the women that they send to their deaths.§
The paper's sailing correspondent has previously written about his constant anquish of having a son at war.
The servicemen, both from Juliet Company 42 Commando Royal Marines, were engaged in a mission to disrupt insurgent activity in the Loy Mandeh area at the time of the explosion, the Ministry of Defence said.

The international coalition admitted the deaths hours after Hamid Karzai had given America a ※final warning§ to change its tactics and avoid killing civilians.
A statement said aircraft, which locals said were helicopters, fired into a house where insurgents had fled after killing a United States Marine.
Nato admitted killing nine civilians in Naw Zad district on Saturday, though Afghan officials had earlier put the death toll at 14, including 12 children.
After the attack, a delegation of villagers carried the bodies of eight children to the provincial governor＊s house shouting: ※See they aren＊t Taliban!§, according to reports.
General John Toolan, commander of Nato forces in south western Afghanistan, said: ※Any loss of life is a true tragedy and I extend my personal condolences to the families and friends of the US Marine, and to the people of Afghanistan for those who were killed or injured.
※The coalition takes each civilian injury or death extremely seriously. It is our top priority to prevent civilian causalities and we continue to improve our practices and strive to prevent these types of incidents from happening.§
He said a US Marine had been killed when his patrol was ambushed on Saturday and five attackers had fled to a compound where they continued to fight.
Airstrikes were called in on the building during the ensuing battle, but ※unfortunately, the compound the insurgents purposefully occupied was later discovered to house innocent civilians§.
The families of those killed would be paid compensation he said.
An investigation team arrived in Naw Zad the morning after the attack and is interviewing marines, pilots and local residents.
The investigation was ※fairly straightforward§ according to military sources, and there was little doubt about what had happened.
Hamid Karzai has repeatedly demanded Nato change tactics to end airstrikes and night raids which have caused anger against coalition forces in southern Afghanistan.
The issue causes intense friction between Mr Karzai and Nato commanders who accuse him of stirring up resentment as a populist ploy.
Mr Karzai said after the attack: ※We have told the Americans and Nato forces several times that uncoordinated operations will result in the killing of innocent civilians and that such operations are inhumane, but still no one has listened."
The Nato statement asked Afghans to ※continue to trust and assist their security forces, so that together we can stop the senseless killing brought upon us by an enemy who wants to exploit the Afghan people through fear and violence§.
A separate investigation team was sent to Do Ab district of Nuristan, where the governor accused the coalition of killing 18 civilians and 20 police during airstrikes during heavy clashes last week.
Up to several hundred militants threatened to overrun the mountainous district last week until Afghan and Nato forces repelled them with an arial bombardment and air assault by commandos.
Police officers had just retaken a location during the fighting when it was hit by ※friendly fire§, the governor said.
"Civilians were killed because the Taliban... (who) ran out of ammunition fled into the civilians' houses and then the civilians were mistaken with the Taliban and fired upon," he added.










The monarch is understood to have expressed her anxiety about the Scottish National Party＊s plan for an independence referendum during her weekly meeting with David Cameron at Buckingham Palace.
Palace officials have asked Downing Street to provide a constitutional expert to advise on how the referendum will be staged and the dismantling of the UK in the event of a ＆yes＊ vote.
Mr Salmond, the SNP party leader, has previously moved to reassure the Royal Family and sceptical Scots by arguing that the Queen would remain head of state in Scotland following separation.
But a source close to Mr Cameron told a Sunday newspaper the monarch＊s commitment to the 304-year-old Union between England and Scotland remained strong.
Although she cannot be seen to express a personal opinion, she is said to be concerned at the prospect of Britain being broken up during her reign.
※She has always been very clear about the United Kingdom and you just have to look at the way the Royal Family are committed to Scotland to see that,§ the source said.
As far back as 1977, when the Labour Government was proposing Scottish devolution, she appeared to suggest she was concerned about the ramifications for the Union.
In a remark interpreted as criticism of home rule, she told MPs: ※I cannot forget I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom.§
A senior Buckingham Palace source confirmed the monarch discussed with Mr Cameron the ramifications of this month＊s Scottish Parliament election, which saw the SNP win an unprecedented majority.
※Regardless of Her Majesty＊s personal views, it is the job of her private secretary to take these issues seriously and to investigate them, and that＊s precisely what＊s going on,§ he said.
Mr Salmond has made clear he intends to stage the referendum ※well into§ the second half of his five-year term. In the intervening period, he intends to stage a propaganda campaign to win over the Scottish public.
A spokesman for the Scottish First Minister dismissed reports of the Queen＊s concern as ※nonsense and chit-chat§. A Buckingham Palace spokesman refused to comment on her private discussions.







Now the teenage pop star appears to have made a business deal with the Middleton family.
Party Pieces, the website owned by the Middletons, has recently won a lucrative deal to sell Justin Bieber merchandise.
It is one of a number of new lines being sold through the website in the last few weeks including Disney＊s Toy Story 3 and Nintendo＊s Super Mario.
Bieber watched the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and was taken not only by the bride but also by her bridesmaid, Pippa.
Like many others he tweeted about Miss Middleton＊s comely appearance informing his 10 million followers: ※Congrats to William and Kate...and Kate＊s sister.§
And the Middletons, it seems, are just as taken with him.
Their online newspaper The Party Times, which is produced by Miss Middleton, announced: ※We＊ve got Bieber fever.§
Representatives for the Canadian singer confirmed that Party Pieces would be selling the Justin Bieber Party Kit, along with other items.
The set costs ㏒20.89 and includes plates, cups, napkins, banner and balloons for up to 16 guests.
Cheaper alternatives include a pack of four badge necklaces for ㏒1.99 and a pack of decorative award ribbons for ㏒2.25. A pinata is also for sale for ㏒13.99.
The Party Times article said: ※Teenage girls around the world go crazy for Bieber. In fact, they love Justin Bieber so much that the op star now has his very own party-ware.§
The article goes on to give red carpet tips on ※pop star§ dress cards and how to turn your father into a fake paparazzi photographer.
It is thought that Party Pieces has seen a significant increase in business since the royal wedding, particularly from America.










The royal couple will travel more than 14,000 miles (22,530km) in 11 days during next month＊s tour of Canada and America, in what will be the new bride＊s first visit to both countries.
St James＊s Palace on Monday released a brief itinerary of the couple＊s trip, which will take in nine cities throughout the region from June 30 to July 10.
A royal source said the couple were ※very much looking forward to their first joint royal tour§.
It is understood that the Canadian government will foot the two million dollar bill for that part of the tour as the Commonwealth country is one of the Queen's realms 每 meaning she is not a foreign monarch but the country's sovereign and head of state.
This means that Prince William, 28, and the former Kate Middleton, 29, are members of the Canadian royal family and the country's authorities are taking the lead in organising the trip.
The newly married pair, who are said to be ※eagerly anticipating§ their summer tour, will be flown by the Royal Canadian Air Force during their nine days in Canada before they are flown to Los Angeles for their three day tour.
Covering more than 5100 miles across the continent＊s vast open spaces, the pair will visit destinations including Charlottetown on the shores of Prince Edward Island in the east, to the remote settlement of Yellowknife in the Northwest Territories, in the far north.
They will also visit Canada's capital, Ottawa and the surrounding region, Montreal and Quebec City in the francophone province of Quebec and the oil boom town of Calgary, Alberta.
Officials confirmed that security will be beefed up for their visit In Quebec amid fears nationalists will protest the royals' stop in the mostly French-speaking province.
One of the tour＊s highlights will be the royal couple's appearance at Canada Day celebrations in the Ottawa on July 1.
The visit to Alberta, during their final leg, also coincides with the opening of the city's world-famous rodeo event, the Calgary Stampede 每 an annual rodeo, exhibition and festival dubbed the "Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth".
The pair will then take in a glimpse of Hollywood, when they travel to Los Angeles and the surrounding area on a three-day official visit supporting Britain's interests in America.
That leg of the tour will also involve promoting charities the Prince is patron of, including Tusk Trust, and will almost certainly include a function on behalf of Bafta, of which the Duke is President.
While the Duchess has never touched down on American soil, it will also be the first time her husband has visited the country in an official capacity.
The pair, who married last month at Westminster Abbey, will then take a ※scheduled§ flight home from Los Angeles.
Asked whether a Bafta event would mean the couple meeting Hollywood A-listers, a St James's Palace spokesman said: "They may well bump into one or two stars at some point.
※But there are different types of functions you could organise to promote Bafta, such as a reception for up and coming talent, so it would be wrong to assume they will be in a room full of celebrities.
"The visit to California is very much about promoting charities."
The visit had originally been planned as a solo trip for the duke but after last November's engagement announcement the duchess was added to the arrangements.
The Canadian Government has themed the tour "'Moving Forward Together' from past accomplishments to current service and future achievements§.
James Moore, Canada＊s Heritage Minister, confirmed the entire visit will cost Canadian taxpayers just under two million dollars.
Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister, added: "Canadians hold the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in very high esteem and look forward to welcoming them as they embark on their first official royal tour as newly-weds.
"The couple's decision to visit Canada first is a testament to our country＊s close relationship with the Crown and Royal family, and an opportunity for all Canadians to take pride in our traditions, history, and institutions.
"I am confident that, in coming to know this country and its people better, the Duke and Duchess will develop their own enduring bonds of affection for Canada and Canadians as has been the case with Her Majesty The Queen over sixty years, which began with her own very first tour as Princess Elizabeth at the age of 25 in 1951."
The royal family have been regular visitors to Canada during the Queen's reign, with the Queen travelling there more than 20 times.
The Duke last visited Vancouver aged 15 in 1998 with his father, the Prince of Wales and brother Prince Harry.
The trip will be the duchess's first overseas tour as a member of the royal family.
But she has a family connection to the Commonwealth country as her grandfather Peter Middleton, who died last year aged 90, served as an RAF flight instructor during the Second World War training Canadian pilots in Calgary from 1942 to 1944.
It is thought the duchess may pay tribute to her grandfather while in Canada.
According to reports, the duchess is a fan of Lucy Maud Montgomery's book Anne of Green Gables, which is set in Prince Edward Island, and so she may visit those sites while William, a search and rescue pilot, takes a Coast Guard helicopter out.
Further details are expected to be released later.









Major retail chains are prepared to take tougher action to enforce disabled bays after being urged to do so by Norman Baker, the local transport minister.
There are 2.5 million blue badge holders in Britain. While local authorities can issue fines to motorists who illegally use disabled bays on the public highway, they are powerless to act on private land.
"Many disabled people and disability groups have told me about the problems they have in finding a disabled bay at supermarkets because of their abuse by people who have no justification for parking in reserved spaces,§ Mr Baker said.
His appeal for tougher action has been backed by seven chains: Aldi, Marks and Spencer, Morrisons, Sainsbury＊s, Tesco, Waitrose and Lidl.
They have said that able-bodied motorists using the bays will be issued parking charge notices - the private equivalent of a parking ticket.
Motorists could also be shamed by having the model and number plate of their car read out over the store＊s tannoy system.
※We have always been concerned about disabled parking spaces and we will penalise those able-bodied drivers that incorrectly park in spaces allocated for blue-badge drivers,§ said Mark Gunter, Morrisons＊ group retail director.
※However, we also depend on the public to help us ensure that these parking bays remain available for disabled drivers."
The move was backed by the AA. ※Our view is that penalties need to be severe because the kind of person who would park in a disabled bay would laugh off a smaller fine,§ a spokesman said.
※Anybody who has challenged an able-bodied motorist who parks in a bay is likely to get a tongue-lashing, if not worse.§









The wardens, known as civil enforcement officers, are to walk out on Tuesday in a dispute over pay.
Southampton is one of more than 270 local authorities which has control over parking and keeps the cash raised from fines, permits and money pumped into meters or pay and display machines.
It is estimated that the strike will cost Southampton ㏒100,000 in lost parking revenue.
A spokesman for Southampton council said that managers would step in for the 33 enforcement officers who are expected to take industrial action.
It means that some parking tickets will be issued, especially in council car parks which will be more closely monitored.
But enforcement otherwise is likely to be patchy, which could lead to drivers gambling on being able to get away without paying.
Police will still be on hand to tow away cars which are causing an obstruction, for example by being double-parked.
A Southampton spokesman said that the council hoped that motorists would be honest and pay for their parking.
In 2008 motorists in Eastbourne enjoyed a respite from wardens and clampers because of a dispute between the town, which was run by the Liberal Democrats and Tory-run East Sussex County Council.
However an AA spokesman sounded a note of caution over the prospect of skeleton parking enforcement in Southampton.
※Drivers will still want to be very careful where they park or they could still get a very nasty surprise.
※Even if there are only a few wardens around, they could still be looking for a bumper ticket harvest.§









Proposals to penalise companies who breach overcrowding limits will be included in a White Paper to be unveiled later in the year.
It was one of the key recommendations of Sir Roy McNulty in his report on the rail industry published earlier this month (May).
Overcrowding is defined as carrying Passengers in Excess of Capacity 每 known as PIXC and 每 within the industry.
One option would impose the fines on the companies who breached these limits by a significant amount.
This, it is believed, would give companies an incentive to invest in carriages, especially with the Government committed to longer franchises.
At same time the Government is considering adopting another McNulty recommendation which would see fares tweaked to spread demand across not only the rush hour but also just before and after.
Overcrowding remains one of the most sensitive issues in the rail industry both on commuter and long distance services.
In 2008 figures provided by the Department for Transport showed that on some services passengers were packed so tight that the conditions would have been illegal for goats, chickens, calves and sheep under EU animal welfare legislation.
Some of the most crowded trains are already carrying 50 per cent more passengers than they were designed to.
Earlier this year the DfT identified the most overcrowded train as the 06.12 from Didcot to London was carrying 248 passengers more than its capacity of 395.
There have been similar complaints on some long distance journeys with passengers complaining that they have been forced to stand for several hours on some trains, such as the busiest London to Edinburgh services.
Ministers believe that the current arrangements provide no incentive for rail operators to tackle overcrowding.
A packed train represents more income for a train operator, while providing additional rolling stock adds to their running costs.
Forcing train operators to pick up the bill for tackling overcrowding could, however, lead to companies bidding less for franchises in future 每 a prospect which is understood to have alarmed the Treasury.
A number of measures have already been taken including requiring train operators to fit devices which would count the number of passengers on their trains.
One entails using a beam which records people as they board. The alternative is based on estimating the number of passengers by the weight of the carriage at the time. According to the industry this method, while appearing unsophisticated, has proved reliable.
A spokesman for the Association of Train Operating Companies said: ※Overcrowding is a big concern for train companies 每 as private sector operators their business relies on keeping their customers happy.
※Train companies want to be able to run more and longer services to deal with overcrowding but have too often been hindered by prescriptive franchise agreements that limit their ability to respond quickly to what passengers want.
※The Government＊s changes to franchising policy are a positive step that should allow operators to respond to issues such as overcrowding more quickly and flexibly.§
Ashwin Kumar, Passenger Focus rail director, welcomed the proposals. ※Getting a seat is a top priority for passengers and all the projections say overcrowding is only going to get worse,§ he said,
※It＊s about time we saw the problem measured accurately across the country so passengers can be confident that new carriages are going to the right place.
※Given the predictions of more and more passengers, we will want to see future franchises contain measures to tackle overcrowding.
※If this is in the form of financial incentives, it＊s important that train companies can＊t simply meet their obligations by fiddling with the fares structure to dissuade people from travelling.§









Services in both directions between Grantham, Lincolnshire, and Peterborough, Cambridgeshire, are unable to run after the technical glitch affected four power lines at around 10.20am, causing major delays for travellers on the east coast main line, which runs between Aberdeen and London's Kings Cross.
A spokeswoman for train operator East Coast said delays were estimated at around two hours and advised against travel that was not ''absolutely necessary''.
The delays could spell Bank Holiday misery for hundreds of passengers heading to the capital, including football fans on their way to take in the Champions League final between Barcelona and Manchester United at Wembley tonight.
The East Coast spokeswoman said: ''There has been an overhead line failure around the Grantham area. Four lines are down, which means no trains are running between Grantham and Peterborough.
''Southbound services from Peterborough are fine.
''There is no current estimate for when a normal service will resume. We are advising customers not to travel unless absolutely necessary.
''Network Rail are on-site dealing with the problem now.''
A Network Rail spokesman said the delays were caused by damaged overhead power lines.
He said: "Approximately 200m of overhead equipment is damaged, affecting all four lines.
"As a result, no services are currently able to operate between Grantham and Peterborough. Shuttle services are running between London King's Cross and Peterborough, and between Grantham and destinations north.
"Network Rail engineers are on site and are working to fix the problem as quickly as possible."
The spokesman added: "Due to the extent of the damage, passengers are being advised not to travel to expect major disruption on the East Coast Main Line for the rest of the day, and to seek other routes for their journeys wherever possible. "










Councils will no longer have to ask Whitehall for permission to scrap bylaws banning cycling on the pavement, promenade and through parks.
The aim is to make towns more ※bike friendly§ and encourage people to cycle to work, which ministers regard as eco-friendly.
They feel that many would-be commuters are put off being forced onto busy roads and highways where they feel they are at risk from traffic.
But making it easier for cyclists to use areas normally reserved for pedestrians could also prove controversial amid fears that ※Lycra louts§ will pay scant attention to those on foot.
Nevertheless the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents gave the move a cautious welcome. ※We want to see more people cycling.
※But where there is shared space they have to make sure there is enough room for pedestrians.§
Some councils have already changed their bylaws to open up more paths for cyclists, such as Canterbury which now allows bikes on the promenade at Herne Bay.
Grant Shapps, the local government minister, wants to make it easier for more to follow suit.
※I want to make sure they can cycle in safety and where appropriate use the local parks, promenades and public spaces but all too often unnecessary, unwanted and outdated bylaws instead force them onto nearby busy roads,§ he said.
※We hope this will lead to a lot more cycle paths,§ said Grant Shapps the local government minister
※Amazingly at the moment it needs a minister to sign off scrapping a by law, I think we can trust the locals.§
The move was welcomed by a spokesman for the London Cycling Campaign. ※It seems quite reasonable to me.
※I think local politicians know what is going on in their areas.§
Robert Gifford, Executive Director of the Parliamentary Advisory Council for Transport Safety, said ※What we want to achieve is more people cycling more safely. Fear of traffic is one factor that prevents reluctant cyclists from starting in the first place.
※What is also important is to encourage shared use and shared understanding. For cyclists and pedestrians to share space successfully, there need to be common expectations and mutual courtesy§.










Councils, who according to the latest available figures are raking in more than ㏒300 million a year in fines, are topping up their revenue at the expense of drivers who do not have the right money when they park.
In all there are around 43,000 pay and display machines on the streets of Britain in a market dominated by three companies: Metric, Parkeon and Zeag.
※We provide 65 per cent of local authorities in the UK, but none of the manufacturers machines give change.§ Richard Boultbee, Metric＊s UK sales manager.
The only respite is offered by a handful of councils who either allow motorists to pay by phone or whose machines allocate parking time according to the amount of money paid.
But these councils are in the minority, with nearly all authorities using older devices.
The full extent of the surplus raked in by councils is unclear with only a small minority of the 277 authorities Daily Telegraph prepared to disclose the figure.
In most cases councils rejected applications made under the Freedom of Information Act, claiming that the information was not recorded or it would cost too much to collate.
One local authority, Ashford in Kent, demanded ㏒500 to obtain the figure, saying the amount was needed to reimburse their contractors to find the information.
One of the biggest beneficiaries from the overpayments was Portsmouth, which netted and additional ㏒120,000 in a year.
Parking has become a cash cow for councils since they were took over control from the police under a process known as decriminalisation.
The cash raised has become even more important to local budgets since the election with municipal budgets under pressure.
While councils have been quite happy to pocket the surplus, they are less charitable to motorists who overstay.
Crawley Council in West Sussex raised ㏒18,820 in fines from ※overstayers§, St Albans ㏒79,055 and West Berkshire, ㏒26,018.
The disclosures triggered outrage from motoring groups. "This money might be small change to councils, but in these tough times every penny counts for hard-pressed drivers,§ said Stephen Glaister director of the RAC Foundation.
※This is not a new problem 每 which is more reason why there is no excuse for it still to be happening. If some authorities can at least provide parking time pro-rata to the amount paid, why can't all?§
Andrew Howard of the AA added: ※Faced with ever rising fuel costs motorists will be outraged to see the amounts of money local authorities are making from them just from not giving change in car parks.
※It is hardly surprising that many motorists are now deserting town centres with their council car parks for the free parking at out of town sites.§
Barrie Segal, who runs the website appealNow website said: ※This is absolutely outrageous and confirms motorists view that parking enforcement is just about raising cash and not keeping the traffic moving.§
Norman Baker, the local transport minister, voiced sympathy with motorists＊ plight. ※I can well understand why some motorists feel aggrieved when confronted with a machine that forces them to pay in excess of the stated charge because the machine won＊t give change.§
But the British Parking Association, which represents councils and their contractors defended the position.
※Pay and display machines and parking meters are unable to give change due to a number of reasons, principally the size of machine required to house the necessary coins. This would be impractical and ugly on the average roadside.§
The Local Government Association said any surplus cash was invested in transport infrastructure.

More than three in four peers oppose introducing a wholly or mainly elected upper chamber despite it being one of the main policies in the three parties manifestos.
A majority believe it would be unconstitutional for ministers, to use the Parliament Act to push through such proposals.
The coalition partners have pledged to create an elected Lords by 2015, threatening to overcome objections with the rarely-used mechanism that allows MPs to pass legislation without peers' consent.
But the new research has highlighted the hostility to the move across the political spectrum 每 including among Liberal Democrats.
The findings of the poll will make uncomfortable reading for the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister.
They came from a survey of the 789 peers entitled to sit in the Lords, of whom around 400 do so regularly, that was conducted by The Times.
The newspaper sent questions to each of the peers and received responses from 310, which it said was broadly in proportion to their parties' representation in the chamber.
It found:
* 80 per cent opposed a wholly or mainly elected upper House, even though the policy was in all three party manifestos and is in the coalition agreement.
* Almost three quarters believed it would be unconstitutional to use the Parliament Act.
* 81 per cent said the Lords works well as it is.
* Mr Clegg's peers are deeply divided, with almost two thirds believing that the Lords works well, less than half opposing a large elected element and 54 per cent saying it would be unconstitutional to use the Parliament Act.
The s findings offer the first in-depth survey of opinion in the Lords since Mr Clegg published plans this month to replace its members with a wholly or 80 per cent-elected chamber of about 300.
They would be elected by thirds every five years and serve single 15-year terms.
Baroness D＊Souza, convener of the cross-bench peers, said that legislating for a fully elected upper chamber would in effect be to abolish the Lords.
※Then I think the use of the Parliament Act legally would be impossible," she told the newspaper.







Tracey Crouch, 35, the MP for Chatham and Aylesford in Kent, is a right winger or centre forward who has played for both the 11-a-side and five-a-side teams alongside her male colleagues.
However, the Football Association recently took over the running of the 11-a-side team and under its rules only girls aged 13 or under can play in mixed teams.
Miss Crouch, a keen Tottenham Hotspur fan, said: "I don't want there to be an exemption for me but it seems ridiculous that adult women can't decide if they want to play alongside men if they're good enough.
"It's right that girls can't play alongside boys over 13 - the physical factors are too obvious - but it's ridiculous to apply those rules to something like the Parliamentary football team."
She insisted that she could hold her own against her male counterparts, who include Jim Murphy, the shadow defence secretary, Andy Burnham, the shadow education secretary, and Karl McCartney, the Tory MP for Lincoln.
Asked to give an example of how her skills compared, she said: "Well, I once nutmegged [put the ball through the legs of] Jim Murphy, which might give you a hint. Besides, the Parliamentary team is hardly the Premier League.
"The men's game is fast, more pacey, but women can be more technically adept. If you put a member of Arsenal Ladies team into a men's Sunday League team, I think the men would be surprised."
Miss Crouch is also a qualified football coach and FA referee and has managed Meridian Girls U13s in Kent for three years.
The FA agreed to increase the age at which girls can play in mixed teams from 11 to 13 after Emily Lewis-Clarke, a schoolgirl from Devon, won a battle on the topic.
Th 11-year-old, who plays for Newton Abbott 66 Football Club, got more than 6,000 signatures before handing her petition in to the FA - which agreed the new rules last week and will bring them in next year.









An advert on the jobs section of the party website makes clear that the posts at Lib Dem HQ do not come with a salary. There is a small reimbursement for travel and an allowance of no more than ㏒5 for lunch.
In return for their free labour, the volunteers benefit from "the opportunity to gain experience of the practical and professional side of Party politics... and experience life at the heart of Westminster," according to the advert.
Last month, Mr Clegg launched a new national internship scheme and said such placements should be "properly remunerated" and conform with the minimum wage.
Intern Aware, a campaign group, said the latest advert for the three- and four-month placements was hypocritical because volunteers also needed to be able to afford to live in London to do the job.
A spokesman said: "This job advertisement is clearly for an unpaid internship. You can maybe buy a sandwich for ㏒5 a day but you can't buy a bed to sleep in.
"That means these internships will only be available to a small minority.
"If Nick Clegg is really serious about this, he'll sort his own house out first."
A Lib Dem spokesman said: "What we said was not that they should be paid but that - at the very minimum - they should get proper remuneration for the work that they do. That can be travel costs and money for lunch."












Lord Taylor of Warwick, the first black member of the House of Lords, defrauded the expenses system by more than ㏒11,000.
The 58-year-old, dressed in black suit, blue tie and shirt, looked impassive as the sentence was passed at Southwark Crown Court.
Mr Justice Saunders said Taylor had ruined his life ※not by one stupid action but by a protracted course of dishonesty§.
Taylor was found guilty in January this year for claiming in 2006 and 2007 that his main residence was in Oxford, when he actually owned just the one home in Ealing, west London.
He subsequently claimed an overnight allowance and travelling expenses to which he was not entitled.
It emerged that Taylor had only visited the property in Oxford 每 which is home to his step-nephew Robert Taylor 每 twice and never stayed a night.
When challenged by the media, he said he was living with his elderly mother, who had actually died several years earlier.
Giving evidence, the peer insisted he was told by several other peers that claiming expenses you didn＊t necessarily own was part of the remuneration system.
Mohammed Khamisa QC, defending, had pleaded for a suspended sentence due to the fact his client was a powerful ※role model§ to young black people.
He said the former barrister had dedicated his life to public service and had given up several ※lucrative§ financial contracts to be a member of the House of Lords in 1996.
※He isn＊t motivated by money, glory, pomposity, arrogance or greed.
※He is described as a humble gentleman who for most of his life has dedicated himself to public services.§
Mr Khamisa said his client had a series of good character references from lawyers, members of the public, as well as three peers.
He said several senior figures from the church had stepped forward to vouch for Taylor, while the Speaker＊s chaplain had begged the court for ※mercy§.
The barrister said his client had battled racism throughout his life, but had been determined to stay in public life.
Describing the effect of his expenses, Mr Khamisa said: ※He is a man of previous good character who has made a single, monumental error of judgement which has destroyed his life, a life which was otherwise a distinguished life.§
After sentencing, a spokesman from Taylor＊s solicitors said: ※Lord Taylor is distraught with the sentence but fully accepts the court＊s decision.
※Upon his release he will continue to serve the public, as he has done for the past 20 years, with the charitable organisations he has worked for.§









A single flare was fired above the city's docklands to signify the exact moment - 12.13pm - 100 years ago when the ill-fated liner rolled down the slipway and touched the water for the first time.
All boats in the area around the Harland and Wolff shipyards, where the pride of the White Star fleet was built, then sounded their horns.
In 1911, thousands of cheering well-wishers gathered at the same place to celebrate the historic moment.
A century on, the mood was again one of celebration at the event on the Queen's Island slipway which focused more on the ship's construction than its fate.
After the flare was fired, crowds clapped for exactly 62 seconds - the length of time it took for the liner to roll down the slipway in 1911.
The Titanic sank on her maiden transatlantic voyage 11 months after her launch, with the loss of more than 1,500 lives, when she struck an iceberg.
Among the invited guests at the commemoration were schoolchildren and representatives from the four other cities and towns directly connected to the Titanic story - Cherbourg in France, Cobh (formerly Queenstown) in Co Cork, Liverpool and Southampton.
The Harlandic and Queen's Victoria male voice choirs sang a number of hymns during the half-hour service close to the almost-complete ㏒100 million Titanic visitors centre, which is set to open ahead of next year's centenary of the liner's sinking in 1912.
Earlier, a major new exhibition on the Titanic opened at the nearby Ulster Folk and Transport Museum, boasting some artefacts recovered from the liner that have never been put on public display before.
Descendants of many of the men who helped build the ship, some of whom sailed on the first voyage and died in the maritime disaster, attended the service.
Lord Mayor of Belfast, councillor Niall O Donnghaile, said Belfast's role in the Titanic story had been overlooked in the past.
"The Titanic story is probably one of the most fascinating, amazing, poignant, thought-provoking and absorbing tales from the last century, if not the last millennium," he said.
"For too long, Belfast's part in the Titanic story, and the role of the people of Belfast in bringing Titanic to life, has been neglected.
"Over the past few years, the city that gave birth to the ship, and many others, has finally and rightfully acknowledged her part in the tale, and today we are proud to celebrate the achievement, epitomised by this historic moment, and educate the world about our city's role in the Titanic story."








The list, which was originally posted over the weekend, was taken down on Monday with less than 200 people following.
But the page was republished hours later and represents the most blatant attempt yet to defy the courts by breaching injunctions.
The anonymous poster included links to alleged court documents as well as full names and even addresses of some people who have allegedly been granted injunctions.
But not all of the information appeared to be accurate prompting further fears that innocent people were being unfairly tainted because of the rash of secrecy orders being granted.
The page appeared on Twitter just hours after the US based company caved into a legal challenge and agreed to release the personal details of five account holders in an attempt to find an anonymous British blogger who had been posting allegedly libellous comments about officials at South Tyneside Council.
The landmark case has potentially far reaching implications for Twitter users who have used the site anonymously to breach injunctions.
Earlier this month lawyers acting for the Manchester United footballer Ryan Giggs issued a writ demanding Twitter release the details of a user who named their client as having taken out an injunction to hide an alleged extramarital affair with Imogen Thomas, a former reality television star.
Anyone knowingly breaching a court injunction by naming an individual could be found in contempt of court and fined or even jailed.
But with thousands of internet users ignoring the warnings, injunctions are becoming increasingly difficult to enforce.
Liberal Democrat MP John Hemming has also said he will use parliamentary privilege to name any celebrities who threaten to prosecute those who reveal their identities.
He said celebrities should not be allowed to ※erode British culture§ by threatening to have people jailed for simply ※gossiping about them§.








Sasha Hall, 22, claimed dozens of people raided the bin outside the Tesco Express store in Great Baddow, Essex, following a power failure on January 29.
But she denied theft at Chelmsford Crown Court, saying instead that a bag full of food had been delivered to her flat above the store by a friend.
Prosecutor Anil Patani told the court store managers had been forced to throw away about ㏒10,000 worth of spoilt food following the power cut.
He said that when interviewed by police, Hall, who worked part-time at a rival supermarket in Chelmsford, said she was a regular customer at the store and had noticed the failure of fridges and freezers earlier in the day.
That evening a friend had delivered a bag, mainly containing 100 packets of ham, to her house and asked ''Do you want some free food?''.
Mr Patani told the court: ''She told the police that she did not know what she was receiving and was disappointed there was so much ham as she would have preferred some steak.
''She said that people from all over the estate had raided the bins.''
Defence advocate Emma Davenport said Hall had not been the person who packed the bags.
''When she took delivery of the bags she discovered they mostly contained ham and not much of any other variety,'' she added.
''She did not plan to distribute the goods.''
Hall currently holds down two jobs as she struggles with financial difficulties, she added.
Hall also admitted possession of cannabis. A count of theft was left to lie on file.
Judge Rodger Hayward Smith adjourned sentencing until June 20. He said: ''This is a far more serious matter than I first thought.''
Hall did not comment as she left court but earlier told the Essex Chronicle: ''There was ㏒3,000 worth of food going to waste on the street. It had been thrown out, so I thought I could put it to better use.
''When the police came round I was so upset. I felt like a terrible criminal.
''I would think the police have better things to be doing with their time than going after people who pick up potato waffles from the street. It's all been blown totally out of proportion.
''Tesco clearly did not want the food. They dumped it and rather than see it go to waste, I thought I could help feed me and my family for a week or two.''









There is a chance, albeit small, that some of the transactions for the first tranche of tickets will not have been completed by the end of today and might take place before June 10. However, the organisers say that the vast majority of people will have been charged by close of play on May 31. The formal announcement of which tickets you got (and whether you definitely, absolutely didn't get any at all) only happens by June 24.
If you didn't get a single ticket
The London Organising Committee of the Olympic Games have promised that those who failed to secure a single seat will be put into a special pool of applicants and given priority when tickets are re-released in winter. Those who are eligible will be emailed or contacted about a week before they go sale, so you'll need to keep a regular check on your in-box. When it happens, you will have to act fast because this second stage of the ticket sale will operate on a first-come, first-served basis and participants will have a week before others join the battle.








Within twenty years, the charity has predicted that the cost of crops could increase by up to 180 per cent.
"The food system is pretty well bust in the world," Oxfam Chief Executive Barbara Stocking told reporters, announcing the launch of the Grow campaign as 925 million people go hungry every day.
"All the signs are that the number of people going hungry is going up," Stocking said
"The food system must be overhauled if we are to overcome the increasingly pressing challenges of climate change, spiralling food prices and the scarcity of land, water and energy."
Hunger was increasing due to rising food price inflation and oil price hikes fuelled by speculators, scrambles for land and water, and creeping climate change, Oxfam said.
The charity warned that food prices will increase by something in the range of 70 to 90 percent in real terms by 2030 before taking into account the effects of climate change, which would roughly double price rises again.
Although wheat prices have remained stable in 2011 they are 70 per cent higher than a year ago after rising sharply last summer as the worst drought in decades devastated crops in the Black Sea region.
Prices for corn have more than doubled in the last 12 months with global production unable to keep pace with record demand.
The report said the failure of the food system flowed from failures of government to regulate and to invest, which meant that companies, interest groups and elites had been able to plunder resources.
"Now the major powers, the old and the new, must cooperate, not compete, to share resources, build resilience, and tackle climate change," it said.
"The economic crisis means that we have moved decisively beyond the era of the G8, when a few rich country governments tried to craft global solutions by and for themselves.
"The governments of poorer nations must also have a seat at the table, for they are on the front lines of climate change, where many of the battles -- over land, water, and food -- are being fought."








The number of candidates attempting to get into British universities is set to top 700,000 for the first time, figures suggest, as students race to beat a rise in tuition fees in 2012.
Applications were up by 1.4 per cent at the end of May 每 the highest total for that point in the academic year.
Demand is strongest for practical courses more likely to lead straight to a job, such as nursing, engineering, the sciences and business and management studies. Fewer students are competing for places in many language and humanities subjects.
The overall rise is being fuelled by a surge in demand from students from mainland Europe who are eligible for the same Government-backed loans as British undergraduates.
Ministers insisted applications had ※levelled off§ after a huge rise in interest before Christmas.
Demand was up by more than 20 per cent at the end of 2010, although applications have declined sharply since the turn of the year.
But student leaders said a failure to provide more university places this autumn would still leave hundreds of thousands of candidates without degree courses.
Aaron Porter, president of the National Union of Students, said: ※Last year over quarter of a million qualified and ambitious young people missed out on a deserved place at university.
※This year the Government has failed to add to the number of university places＃ meaning we are likely to see an increase in the numbers being denied a place.§
Data from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (Ucas) shows applications are up by 1.4 per cent so far this year. If the trend continues into the summer, it will result in some 707,000 applications in total 每 almost 10,000 more than 2010.
This is likely to leave almost 220,000 students without a place in August 每 more than a third of those applying.
Reports suggest that many students are axing gap years to push for a university place this summer, instead of waiting until 2012 when the cap on annual tuition fees in England soars from ㏒3,290 to ㏒9,000.
Overall, the biggest rise in applications is from students from mainland Europe, with demand up by 5.6 per cent. Some 45,727 had applied by the end of May.
David Willetts, the Universities Minister, suggested students who miss out on places should consider alternative courses, such as apprenticeships.
※Going to university has always been a competitive process and not all who apply are accepted,§ he said.
※Despite this we do understand how frustrating it is for young people who wish to go to university and are unable to find a place.
※We are opening up other routes into a successful career.
※Our reforms will make part-time university study more accessible and we are also investing in new apprenticeship places, with at least 250,000 more apprenticeships available over the next four years."

The remarks, some of the strongest by a senior US official since China launched a major crackdown earlier this year, came as Mrs Clinton was meeting with senior leaders from Beijing as part of the two nations' annual dialogue.
"They're worried, and they are trying to stop history, which is a fool's errand," Mrs Clinton told The Atlantic magazine, referring to Chinese officials.
"They cannot do it. But they're going to hold it off as long as possible," she said.
Chinese authorities, apparently spooked by the wave of pro-democracy uprisings sweeping the Middle East, have detained dozens of lawyers, artists and other perceived critics in recent weeks.
China has rejected US criticism. But offering a more conciliatory tone, Executive Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun said that Beijing has made "remarkable progress" since the communist state was established in 1949.
"I want to stress that the Chinese government is committed to protecting and upholding human rights and we will ensure and protect people's freedom of religious faith in accordance with the law," Mr Zhang told reporters in Washington.
"No country including the United States is perfect on the human rights issue. It is only natural for China and the United States to see human rights differently in some aspects," Mr Zhang said.
"So we call for a dialogue and consultation on the basis of equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs," he said.
Despite her criticism on human rights, Mrs Clinton defended the US policy of seeking co-operation with China on a range of global issues, saying in the magazine interview: "We live in a real world."
"We don't walk away from dealing with China because we think they have a deplorable human rights record. We don't walk away from dealing with Saudi Arabia," she said.
The United States said it was raising specific cases with China during the two-day Strategic and Economic Dialogue, which closes on Tuesday. Beijing has repeatedly rejected foreign concerns on human rights.
In the magazine interview, Mrs Clinton also voiced concern that the United States and its allies were failing to project their influence at a time that China's state media was rapidly expanding its presence around the world.
She pointed to planned spending cuts by the BBC, part of a budget-cutting drive under way both in Britain and the United States.
"We are losing the war of ideas because we are not in the arena the way we were in the Cold War," Mrs Clinton said.
"I just feel like we're missing an opportunity. And I'm well aware of our budget constraints and all of the difficulties we face, but now is the time," she said.










Officials at the Forbidden City told police that seven items belonging to an exhibit on loan from a private Hong Kong museum and valued at up to 10 million yuan (㏒1m) were stolen on Sunday, the Beijing News said.
After viewing video surveillance tapes, police are seeking the man as the chief suspect in the theft, the paper said.
Telephone calls to the Forbidden City went unanswered on Wednesday, but a posting on the Palace Museum's microblog confirmed that the theft took place.
The missing items, which date from the early 20th century, include jewellery boxes and women's make-up cases, the report said.
The items were taken from the Zhai Gong exhibit hall in the northeastern part of the sprawling palace, where the display was to continue until June 27, it added. The section was closed to tourists following the incident.
The exhibit was on loan from the Liangyicang museum, which is owned by a Hong Kong collector identified as Feng Yaohui, the paper said.
In the most recent theft attempt at the heavily guarded Forbidden City, police in 1987 captured a man identified as Xiang Dexiang, who was unsuccessful but was still sentenced to life in prison, the Global Times reported.
According to police records, only four thefts have been recorded at the Forbidden City between 1949 and 1987, the paper said.
Located in central Beijing, the Forbidden City was first built in the early decades of the 15th century and served as the imperial palace of China's Ming and Qing Dynasties. It was transformed into the Palace Museum in 1925 after the fall of the Qing.









Ai is an outspoken critic of the Chinese government and has not been heard from since he was arrested at Beijing airport on April 3.
Kapoor described China＊s actions as ※barbaric§ and said that the failure of the international community to do more than voice concern was ※ridiculous§.
The Turner Prize-winner called for the art world to ※come together§ and do more to campaign for Ai's release.
Speaking on BBC Radio 4＊s Today programme he said: ※As artists we have a communal voice and it＊s important that we stick together.
※This takes us back to a Soviet-style time when the voice of artists of different kinds was seen as being dangerous.
※It does bear witness to the barbarity of governments if they are that paranoid that they have to put away artists.§
Kapoor, 57, has dedicated a sculpture from his new show to Ai which was unveiled in Paris yesterday.
The 'Leviathan' art installation, which is part of the exhibition Monumenta currently held at the Grand Palais, stands 37 metres high and is designed for to be walked inside as if in the belly of a monster.
Kapoor said: ※Perhaps all museums and galleries should be closed for a day...some such campaign needs to form itself.
※All he has done...is make it clear that every life matters. Surely that＊s the right thing to do.§
Ai, 53, was detained as he tried to take a flight to Hong Kong and has been held for so-far unspecified economic crimes. He has been denied contact with his lawyer or any family members.
His family and colleagues say he is being targeted for his repeated assaults on what he calls China's "totalitarian" one每party State.
Kapoor said: ※His family doesn＊t know where he is. This is not acceptable.§
Sir Salman Rushdie spoke out in support of Ai in an article written for the Daily Telegraph last month when he described the Chinese government as ※the world＊s biggest threat to freedom of speech§.
Although the artist is still detained two major exhibitions of Ai's' work will open in London this week.
Somerset House will display his Circle of Animals/Zodiac Heads in its courtyard from May 12 until June 26. The Lisson Gallery is also exhibiting some of Ai's key works created over the past six years. The Tate Modern has just finished showing his work Sunflower Seeds.










The 820-mile fast-line connecting China's political and commercial capitals is scheduled to open by the end of June and is the latest example of China's astonishing drive to modernise and expand its railway infrastructure.
In a testament to China's ability to drive through infrastructure projects, the Beijing-Shanghai line will have been completed in just three years.
Ticket prices have yet to be announced, but estimates based on fare prices for similar high-speed lines suggest the standard class journey could cost between ㏒50 and ㏒100 one-way, or slightly cheaper than the average air fare.
China already boasts the world's largest high-speed rail network with 5,193 miles of high-speed track laid by the end of 2010. However that total will reach 8,123 miles by the end of this year and should exceed 9,940 miles by 2015, according to rail ministry figures.
Britain is currently in the consultation phase for its High Speed 2 rail project, a two-pronged track that will link London to Leeds and Manchester via the West Midlands at a cost of ㏒32bn. If approved, the project is expected to take 20 years to compete.
Diplomatic sources also say that China - which has already signed railway co-operation agreements with 30 countries, including the US, Russia, Poland and India - is showing 'great interest' in investing in UK railways and infrastructure.
However China's hyper-rapid rail expansion, while still the envy of much of the world, has not been without its recent problems.
With investment levels running at almost ㏒70bn a year, there have been allegations of widespread corruption, leading to the sacking and detention last February of the railways minister Liu Zhijun on suspicion of taking payouts in exchange for awarding contracts.
Questions have also been raised about the long-term solvency of China's railways ministry which showed a ㏒350m pre-tax loss for the first quarter of 2010 and has run up mountainous debts of almost ㏒200bn 每 equivalent of 58 per cent of its total assets - a figure some analysts warn is dangerously high.
The safety of the rapidly laid tracks was also questioned after the ministry announced it was reducing speeds of trains from 220mph to 185mph earlier this month, although officials said the reduction was aimed at cutting running costs and offering the public cheaper fares.
Some economists have also warned that China's rail-building spree is creating unwanted levels of excess capacity, which is being duplicated by the expansion of gleaming new provincial airports which are mushrooming across China.
Others disagree, arguing that the extra capacity will be soaked up in future years by China's development and that China's rail and road investment is by many measures equivalent to that of the United States at a similar period of economic development.
However despite the recent difficulties, much of China's public are happy to embrace the new railways as a symbol of the nation's rapid economic development, with railway staff reporting they had been inundated with enquiries of how to buy tickets on the inaugural service.









Embarrassed officials were at a loss to explain how the thieves, possibly posing as tourists or workmen, managed to evade the blanket security at the palace of China's late emperors, which is one the most tightly guarded sites in China.
More than 1,600 antitheft alarms and some 3,700 closed-circuit television cameras were apparently insufficient to prevent the theft from a visiting exhibition that was being staged in the Forbidden City's Palace of Abstinence.
"For this to happen here shows us that, number one, we need to speed up the modernisation and installation of our security systems," said Feng Naien, an official at the palace museum which is one of the world's leading tourist attractions.
"Number two, we need to investigate carefully and find out if we can implement better, more modern and more sophisticated security systems here."
Mr Feng added that in the early hours of Monday morning guards had seen a suspect fleeing the scene by the Palace of Abstinence in the northeast corner of Forbidden City complex, but unfortunately had been unable to capture him.
Police are now hunting for a 27-year-old man who is said to have come from outside Beijing, according to China's state media.
The Forbidden City's security system is currently in the middle of a security upgrade that will install further cameras and is due for completion in October this year.
The seven stolen items had come from a temporary exhibition of early 20th century Chinese furniture, jewellery boxes and bags from the collections of the privately-run Liangyicang Museum in Hong Kong. Two other were recovered in the grounds of the museum, slightly damaged.
They included a make-up box set with olivine, or "evening emerald", and studded with irreplaceable diamonds from a mine that is no longer operating, said Wang Xiahong, the president of the Liangyicang Museum.
He also disclosed that the stolen objects were not fully insured since the museum had never believed it possible a thief could break into the Forbidden City. "We are truly regretful for that," he added, admitting the policy only covered up to ㏒30,000.
The heist is the first theft at the Forbidden City for more than 25 years, according to the State-backed Global Times, which said the last attempted theft had taken place in 1987 but was unsuccessful. The culprit, a man named as Xiang Dexiang, was sentenced to life in prison anyway.
Police records showed only four other thefts recorded at the Forbidden City between the founding of Chinese Republic in 1949 and 1987, the paper added.
Although the remaining exhibits were closed to the public yesterday as police investigated the crime scene, the objects' owner, a Hong Kong millionaire collector called Feng Yaohui pledged to provide replacements to keep the exhibition running until its scheduled close on June 27.









Starting on May 14, a new model of MG cars will appear in dealerships across Britain. It is an event long awaited by MG fans across Britain and around the world. It signifies not only the return of one of Britain＊s oldest and most popular auto brands, I am proud to add that the new car is also the latest example of Sino-British joint venture.
China shares the mythology of the famous phoenix firebird with many countries. Chinese people believe that when the phoenix is 500 years old it ignites its nest and burns. Then the phoenix arises from the ashes newly born, and even more vigorous.
The phoenix story was a perfect fit for the extraordinary relaunch of the MG brand. I witnessed the coming off the line of its new model the MG6 at Longbridge a few weeks ago. I saw the Birmingham City Leader, Councilor Mike Whitby, proudly drive a sparkling new red MG6 down the assembly line; he was greeted with wild applause from hundreds of MG fans, along with Chinese and British workers at the plant. It is 16 years since a new MG model rolled off the Longbridge lines.
The MG6 is the first car designed, developed and built in the UK by the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC) since its acquisition of MG.
The MG6, like a lusty new-born phoenix, brings rebirth to a quintessential British brand name. I was delighted to read in the Telegraph Rod Ker's comments after a test drive of the MG6: ※I like it＃Impressive§. In Autocar the test drive got this accolade: ※.. we say bring ＆em on.§
Founded in 1924, the MG is an iconic British sports car. An SAIC manager told me that SAIC has been working hard to return the MG marque to its old glamour; first, through small-scale warm-up production of the MG-TF sports cars in 2008 and now the launch of the new MG6. Very soon, other new designs could spring to life off the drawing board. MG must be very popular as there are 86 MG Clubs around the world. Some of these MG fans chose to celebrate the MG6 launch by driving a dozen classical MG models at the launch ceremony.
Aside from this MG popularity, the MG6 is a splendid example of the burgeoning China-UK business collaboration. I often hear talk, in both our countries, about the great promise of the complementary strengths of our two economies. The launch of the MG6 is living testimony of that vision. The MG6 was designed and developed in Longbridge; then the new model had most of its parts built in the SAIC Shanghai factory. These parts were then shipped to Longbridge for assembly and testing. The concept of "designed in the UK, produced in China and assembled in the UK" enables the MG to retain its marque tradition of "Made in the UK". This formula draws together British innovation, advanced manufacturing, and China＊s competitive costs. The MG6 in every way adds up to success for China, a winner for the UK and a tour de force for co-operation between our two countries.
The MG6 showcases the spirit of corporate responsibility as Chinese businesses seek to go global. In 2005 the Nanjing Automobile Company (NAC), purchased the assets of the MG Rover Group. In turn SAIC took over NAC in 2007. Both NAC and SAIC decided to maintain MG＊s Longbridge facility as an engineering and design centre. The facility employs about 400 people and is now moving back into production. This means the famous Longbridge plant is increasingly contributing to local job creation and economic development. It's a perfect example of a Chinese company fulfilling its responsibilities to the local communities. The launch of the MG6, and the planned other new models, will create more jobs in sales, logistics and maintenance.
In my 14 months so far in Britain, I have been learning about British strengths. I have visited more than ten British leading universities and many factories, and recently the Science Museum in London. These experiences opened my eyes to Britain's outstanding contribution to science and technology. Low carbon and sustainable energy technology advances are a top priority for both our governments. A wave energy project in Scotland, the BRE Innovation Park in England, and other visits have reinforced my impressions. These experiences have convinced me that Britain is leading the world in new energy, high-end manufacturing and the creative industries. The UK, furthermore, is a top investment destination in Europe, thanks to its legal system and open investment climate. Conversations with many officials, business leaders and employees of Chinese businesses and organisations show they share my impressions.
More collaboration between China and the UK offers boundless opportunities. This can be driven by China＊s growing development. China is going to keep a fast and steady economic growth in the next 5 years. The blueprint behind this economic development is China＊s five year planning cycles. The outline of the 12th Five-Year Plan has just been published. This will steer China to upgrade its way of growth by boosting domestic demand; a balance will be found between imports and exports and priority will be given to both inbound and outbound investments. Overall there is a strong stress on making growth green and low-carbon.
The successful launch of MG6 is only one shining example of what can be achieved through collaboration. Britain is a global leader of advanced automotive engineering and design. The proof is demonstrated with over 80 per cent of all Formula One racing cars being designed and built in Britain. China is the world＊s biggest automotive market, so close collaboration will undoubtedly benefit both our countries in this and many other industry and service sectors.
Let us embrace a better future through ever more China-UK business collaboration.
Liu Xiaoming is the Chinese ambassador to Britain.











Water-levels have sunk as low as 10ft in the main thoroughfare of the 3,900-mile long river that stretches from the glaciers of the Tibetan plateau to the coastal city of Shanghai.
The Yangtze river basin is home to one-third of China's population and is responsible for 40 per cent of the country's economic growth.
Emergency teams have been sent to the river's middle reaches around Wuhan in the central province of Hubei, to rescue two ships that have been grounded in the past week and help any others that become stranded.
The river's management office has now closed a 140-mile stretch of the river above Wuhan to ocean-going vessels because of the shallow water.
It also said the river is 160 feet narrower in key sections than it was last year.
Wu Heping, a senior official at the management office said the drought that has affected the Yangtze is the "first we have seen in the past half century" and that the river's water level is "the lowest it has been since 2003, when the Three Gorges Dam went into operation."
He warned that even though storms are imminent, "heavy rain may not raise the water level much".
About 400,000 people in central Hubei province are without drinking water as a result of the drought, and approximately 2.1m acres of farmland have been damaged by it, according to the province's agricultural department.
Although the water level of the Yangtze always drops during the dry winter season, there have been claims that the enormous Three Gorges Dam has exacerbated the problem by changing the water table in the Yangtze basin.
Officials at the dam said they have opened sluice gates, sending over 1,400 cubic feet of water flushing down the river to alleviate the problems and leaving the water level at the dam below the 510ft level needed for optimal power generation.
Wang Jingquan, director of the flood control and drought relief office affiliated with the Yangtze River Water Resources Committee, told the state-run China Daily that damming up the river had aggravated the drought by "pinching off" water flow to lower reaches.
However Zheng Shouren, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering in Beijing and the chief engineer with the Yangtze River Water Resources Committee, argued the opposite, saying that the dam alleviated drought by storing water that would otherwise have been be lost.










Yang Xianwen, 29, reportedly carried out the attack on the Rural Credit Cooperative Union in Tianzhu in the northwestern province of Gansu after being fired from the bank last month for allegedly embezzling funds.
Witnesses said ten employees were seen jumping from the fourth-floor windows of the bank to escape the flames from the homemade petrol bomb which was thrown around 8am. Many others were seen being taken out on stretchers to the local hospital.
Local media, citing officials at the local Communist Party committee, said Yang had fled the scene and was still being sought by police.
Homemade bombs have been used in the past to settle grudges by former employees or those who feel they have been cheated by landlords, bosses and government officials. There have also been several cases of self-immolation in recent years over property disputes and land-grabs.
China's leaders fret openly about the need to maintain social stability in China, spending as much on internal security and vigilance as it does on the People's Liberation Army.
Tianzhu is an area of pasturelands stuck between deserts and mountains with about 200,000 people, about 30 per cent of whom are ethnic Tibetan according to the 2000 census.
Although there have been tensions in recent months between Tibetans and the dominant Han majority, Tianzhu is not known as a hotspot of tensions. Local government reports also said that Yang was a member of Han majority.













Scenes involving Tang Wei hit the cutting room floor after objections that explicit nude sex scenes in the 2007 Ang Lee spy thriller 'Lust, Caution' had rendered her unsuitable for such a sensitive role, according to leaks sourced to the film's crew.
The casting of Miss Tang as "Tao Yi" 每 the young revolutionary who Mao fell in love with in the late 1910s 每 was seen as a signal of her political rehabilitation when it was announced earlier this year.
The role effectively ended a three-year year exile for the Hong Kong-based actress who was banned by state censors from the China's TV screens and billboards in March 2008 in order to guard public morals after clips of the sex scenes emerged on the internet.
However China's film gossip bulletin boards have been buzzing all week to the news that Miss Tang, 32, had been cut from 'The Founding of a Party' after renewed political objections from "Red" families that guard the legacy of the former Communist leader.
The state-backed propaganda blockbuster is due for release next month and features cameos by more than 150 Chinese film stars during its 2hr 11 min running time.
One of China's best-known film directors, He Ping, commented on the apparent decision to cut Miss Tang on Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.
"Make a movie and then cut all her scenes? Her acting is good, both her role and the plot are necessary. It is just due to some reason that cannot be articulated. Others who were once involved are still doing their job legally and reasonably. Only a poor girl has to stand out and take bashing."
Manfred Wong, a Hong Kong director, said in a column in the southern Metropolis Daily on Thursday that "high-level censorship considerations" might have been behind the decision to cut Miss Tang who said was definitely "qualified for her role", but perhaps the final truth would never be known.
The makers of the film refused to be drawn on the cut, saying only that in celebrity ensemble cast movies lots of performances could hit the cutting room floor.
"The scenes of dozens of actors and actresses have been deleted so far. Nobody knows whose are kept and whose will be deleted until the movie is put on screen," said Jiang Defu, spokesman of China Film Group Corporation.
Film and television censorship is becoming an increasingly sensitive topic in China as the ruling Communist Party steps up its efforts to "guide public opinion" to create what it calls a "harmonious and stable society".
Earlier this month Chinese television regulators ordered spy dramas and soap operas should be replaced with politically correct "Red" television until July 1 when the ruling Party will celebrate the 90th year since its founding in Shanghai in 1921.
Online reactions to the reports that Miss Tang's performance had been cut lurched between vitriolic denunciations of the shameful "nude actress" and equally forceful denunciations of Communist Party censorship machine.
"The Party is really ridiculous," said one comment on the Sina microblog, "First they invite Tang Wei to join the cast in order to show their tolerance [and then] they delete all her scenes in order to show their noble taste and make another round of media sensation."
Another called for a boycott of the film. "A bunch of clamorous and ignorant people have taken the control of movies and TV shows [in China]," said another comment posted under the alias 'Power', "They still treat the innocent, kind people with the same method that the Gang of Four and Red Guards used. Can you stop underestimating the people's intelligence?"














While films, television shows and even cartoons about China＊s modern-day leaders are strictly banned, there is an enormous industry in Mao-era drama.
Almost every evening, Chinese television broadcasts so-called ※revolutionary§ soap operas putting Chairman Mao impersonators, who study the mannerisms and voice of the Great Helmsmen, in high demand.
It is even possible to see television variety shows starring Mao Tse-tung and Zhou Enlai, the former Chinese premier, making rousing speeches or playing ping pong against each other.
The first biopic of Mao was The Great River Flows on, which came out in 1978, two years after his death. Since then there have been at least 26 other large-scale productions to capture him on film.
In 2009, the Founding of a Republic, which was made to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the founding of communist China, was a particular success and featured hundreds of stars including the kung fu heroes Jackie Chan and Jet Li.
Gu Yue, an actor who has played Chairman Mao in over 80 films and television programmes, told the state-run China Daily newspaper that China＊s former leader was a ※man of strong emotions and humour with plenty of charisma§.
Like many other Mao impersonators, Mr Gu visited Shaoshan, Mao＊s birthplace in Hunan province, to learn more about his character. He said that after the Chairman returned home in 1959, he had cried after he found out that people had no meat for months because of the Great Famine. ※When Mao returned to Beijing, he refused to eat meat for more than a year,§ claimed Mr Gu.
Other doubles spend hours training their voices to be more highly-pitched and even have plastic surgery to achieve a closer likeness. Tommaso Bonaventura, a photographer, has even compiled an art book of dozens of Mao doppelgangers.
Last October, however, one actor who was scheduled to play Mao in a forthcoming television drama found himself in hot water after it emerged that he had taken British citizenship.
Zhang Tielin, 53, who studied for a master＊s degree at the National Film and Television School in Buckinghamshire in the late 1980s, was attacked by nationalists on several Chinese internet forums as an inappropriate choice to play a revolutionary hero.













The Great Helmsman＊s first wife was Luo Yixiu, a girl from his hometown of Shaoshan, whom he wed in an arranged marriage in 1908 when he was just 14 years old and she was 18.
Mao told the American journalist Edgar Snow: ※When I was 14, my parents married me to a girl of 20. But I never lived with her and I do not consider her my wife.§ Mao was already too ambitious to settle down to a landowner＊s life in the countryside. Just over a year into their marriage, Luo died and Mao left Shaoshan to attend a school 15 miles away.
In 1920, around the same time that Mao began to become involved with the nascent Communist party, he fell in love with Yang Kaihui, the daughter of his former teacher. She was 17 and at first rejected his advances. After her father passed away, however, her affection for Mao grew and she would visit him in the school in Changsha where he had been appointed headmaster.
Their relationship and eventual marriage, however, did not prevent Mao from taking another lover, a widowed tacher called Two Si-yung who was three years his junior. Yang was not deterred, even when she discovered the relationship, and was engaged in revolutionary activities with Mao for all her life, organising movements of peasants, workers, students and women. She bore Mao three sons, but the couple were separated and she was captured by China＊s Nationalist government in 1930 in Changsha and then executed after she refused to publicly denounce Mao. Her eight-year-old son, Mao Anying, was forced to watch her death.
Two years before her death, Mao acquired another wife while he was leading a Communist force in the Jinggang mountains. He Zizhen was 18 and Mao was 34 and they had an unofficial ceremony.
She had three daughters and three sons with Mao, but apart from their daughter Li Min they all died young or were separated from the family as the Communists were forced onto the Long March, an 8,000 mile retreat from the encircling Nationalist forces. Some of the children were left behind on the march in the care of other families. By 1937, their marriage had disintegrated. He Zizhen left for Russia, ostensibly for medical care for a long untreated war wound. Meanwhile, Mao began courting Jiang Qing, who would eventually become Madame Mao, his notorious fourth wife.
Born in 1914, Jiang Qing ran way from home at 14 and eventually became a noted actress in Shanghai. By the time she met Mao in his Yanan base in 1937, she had already been married to, or lived with, four men and her stormy relationships were well chronicled in gossip columns.
Nevertheless the couple married in November 1938 and was behind some of the most lethal campaigns in Chinese history, including the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976 that unleashed total chaos both within the Communist party and throughout the whole of China. She controlled all the media and propaganda and was eventually arrested after Mao＊s death and imprisoned for life. In May 1991 she committed suicide.
According to one of Mao＊s private physicians, Li Zhisui, his sexual appetite was enormous and brazen. Throughout his later years, there were rumours of scores of women being selected and brought to him, and of orgies in Zhongnanhai, the compound where China＊s leaders live.












"As far as censorship goes, the Chinese government had asked for the names of the songs that I would be playing," the folk singer said.
"There's no logical answer to that, so we sent them the set lists from the previous three months. If there were any songs, verses or lines censored, nobody ever told me about it and we played all the songs that we intended to play," he added.
Dylan omitted some of his best-known protest songs from his gigs in Beijing and Shanghai, including "The Times They Are A-Changin'".
The absence of the songs led some concertgoers to wonder if he was avoiding songs with clear political themes or if he had been muzzled by the Communist party.
The folk singer "charged through" his set list, according to one person at the gig at the time, leaving out any banter with the audience between the songs and only introducing his five-piece band after 90 minutes and the first encore.

It will only be three years this summer since the Bird＊s Nest national stadium in Beijing was the most photographed building in the world. It was a symbol of the new China, a collaboration between a Western architectural practice and a famous Chinese artist. In all the excitement, I am afraid I did not catch the name of the Chinese artist, so you could have knocked me down with a feather when I discovered that he was Mr Ai Weiwei, the very fellow who has been locked up for reasons that no one can quite understand. It is now 43 days since this goateed impresario was seized by the Chinese authorities while boarding a flight to Hong Kong. No one seems to know where he is. No one has talked to him.
His mother, his wife and his lawyer have not been able to find out how he is doing, and I am amazed at the relative absence of global furore.
But then I had forgotten that this is the Chinese Year of the Rabbit. What we are hearing is the silence of the rabbits 〞 and all the global rabbits are hoping that if they keep still and say nothing, they will be rewarded with nice, big, crispy wodges of Chinese lettuce. Think of the clamour there would have been, back in the 1980s, if the government of Leonid Brezhnev had banged up a world-famous Soviet artist at the very moment he was exhibiting in London.
Mr Ai has just had a huge, one-man show at Tate Modern, with about a million painted ceramic sunflower seeds, and his works are still drawing the crowds at Somerset House. Artists such as Anish Kapoor (and writers such as Salman Rushdie in this newspaper) have protested at his treatment 〞 but from the politicos the response is verging on the muted. All we have had from the Government, as far as I can see, is a terse statement of disapproval issued by William Hague in early April. Even in the liberal media, there is a curious apathy about the case.
Where are the candlelit vigils, the rallies for Ai Weiwei? Where are the newspaper campaigns and petitions, the why-oh-why-oh-weiweis? Mr Ai＊s work may not be everyone＊s idea of ※art§. He is a conceptual artist, a provocateur. Riffling through a handsome Phaidon edition of his works, I find a series of photographs in which he seems to be flipping his middle finger at the White House, the Eiffel Tower and the Gate of Heavenly Peace in Tiananmen Square.
Anish Kapoor calls for art world to unite behind Ai Weiwei against 'barbaric' China 11 May 2011
There is another series in which he is, for some reason, dropping an expensive Han Dynasty vase on the floor. There is a young girl flashing her knickers in front of a picture of Chairman Mao, a big exhibition in Shanghai called F--- Off, a mutant table with two legs up against the wall and a cubic ton of compressed tea leaves. You can see why he is not everyone＊s cube of tea, and certainly not in the Chinese Communist party.
He was born in 1957 to a film-producer mother and a father who was one of the country＊s leading poets, a man who paid the price for criticising the Communist party by being banished to a part of China called ※Little Siberia§. Ai himself has been a pretty long-standing irritant. When, in 2008, earthquakes caused school buildings in the Sichuan province to collapse, he went and protested about shoddy building standards. He has had his shows cancelled and his studios demolished, and now the Chinese have simply removed him from circulation. They have taken the turps-soaked rag and scrubbed the offending blot from the canvas.
In China, the very fact of his disappearance has itself disappeared. Plug his name into a Chinese search engine, and nothing comes up. They have super-injuncted him out of the story, and the West has responded with the diplomatic equivalent of a protracted fit of coughing. Such leeriness is almost understandable, really.
China today is a very different strategic proposition from the Soviet Union of the 1980s. It was frankly easier to protest at the treatment of dissidents such as Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn, because no one believed that the future belonged to Russia. On the contrary, we could all see that it was a basket case, an economy that couldn＊t supply enough bath plugs for its hotels. No one worried about cheesing off Russian investors 〞 because there weren＊t any. It was Upper Volta with rockets.
China, on the other hand, is about to overtake America as the country with the biggest GDP on earth; China is the new 600lb gorilla of global capitalism; and with Chinese investments and commercial activities still heavily influenced 〞 if not directed 〞 by the politicians of the Communist party, it is no wonder that people are nervous of causing offence. No one wants to rub Beijing up the wrong way, and no one wants to be accused of being ※anti-China§.
Madame Fu Ying, the excellent and highly intelligent former Chinese ambassador to London, has said that it is ※condescending§ for the Western media to make a fuss about Ai Weiwei. I hesitate to disagree with Madame Fu, but surely it would be even more ※condescending§ to say that China should be allowed to continue with breaches of human rights, and to behave in a way that we find unacceptable, just because it is China, and has only lately emerged from centuries of poverty and backwardness. Isn＊t that the real condescension?
Ever since I went to Beijing in 2008, I have been a total sinophile. It is an amazing place, and fully deserves its first-rank status in the world. But I just don＊t believe that the Chinese respect us any more if we bite our tongues and say nothing about cases like Ai Weiwei. On the contrary, they must secretly think it pathetic that we claim to adhere to principles such as freedom from detention without trial 〞 and then do nothing to back up our convictions.
Mr Ai is an internationally famous artist, and it is untenable to claim that locking him up is a purely internal matter. If he is really guilty of failing to pay his taxes, he should be tried in the normal way. If not, it would be a sign of China＊s confidence and greatness if he were released.








Mr Ai, the creator of the Tate Modern＊s Sunflower Seeds exhibition, was allowed to spend 20 minutes with his wife, Lu Qing, at a secret location on Sunday afternoon, helping to dispel online rumours that he had been tortured.
※He seemed conflicted, contained, his face was tense,§ Lu told the Associated Press, ※I could see redness in his eyes. It was obvious that without freedom to express himself he was not behaving naturally even with me, someone from his family.§
She added that the people who arranged the visit showed no identification and warned her not to speak about anything except family or health matters.
※We could not talk about the economic charges or other stuff, mainly about the family and health,§ she said. ※We were careful, we knew that the deal could be broken at any moment, so we were careful.§
The visit came as a relief for other members of his family, including Mr Ai＊s elderly mother. ※The rumours that we've heard about him being tortured have been too much for us to take, but now seeing is believing,§ said Gao Ying.
Fears for Ai＊s physical safety had mounted in recent weeks after online reports that he had been coerced into ※confessing§ after watching a video of another ※disappeared§ dissident, the human rights lawyer Gao Zhisheng being tortured with an electric shock baton.
China has faced mounting international criticism over its detention of Ai Weiwei, who was taken last month during a widespread Chinese clampdown on lawyers, bloggers and artists apparently provoked by the fears that Middle East street revolutions could spread to China.
The novelist Salman Rushdie and the sculptor Anish Kapoor have headed calls from the international artistic community to free Ai Weiwei and urging governments to be more vocal in condemning his arrest.
China has responded by angrily rejected US and European fears that it is ※backsliding§ on human rights, describing such criticisms as ※condescending§ and warning strongly against any interference in its judicial sovereignty.
Ai, 53, is officially being investigated for ※economic crimes§ however his friends, family and colleagues all believe that his detention is because of his outspoken criticism of China＊s ruling Communist Party and the failings of the one-party state.
His mother told The Telegraph that Lu Qing had reassured Ai - who was dressed in his own clothes, not a detention centre uniform - that his family were all strong and well, and that ※tears had welled up in his eyes§ as he heard that good news.
Although the circumstances of the meeting has revealed nothing of Ai＊s exact whereabouts, it might have clarified the legal basis on which he is being held, lawyers said.
Ai＊s family members confirmed to The Telegraph on Monday that they still haven＊t been given any formal indication of the charges he is facing, which according to Chinese criminal law, they should have received no later than 37 days after his detention.
Liu Xiaoyuan, a lawyer and friend of Ai, says the visit now suggests that Ai is being held under a separate section of Chinese law which would allow the authorities to detain him ※living under house surveillance§ (house arrest) for six months.
Although highly unusual, Mr Liu said, it would not be unprecedented for a suspect to be detained under ＆house＊ arrest but outside his own home, even though in normal circumstances suspects under house arrest are allowed telephone contact with the outside world.
While relieved to be granted a visit, Ai＊s family say they still want his case to be resolved quickly and in the open.
"Now that we've seen that his health is okay, of course we are a bit less anxious, but that's not to say we want him to stay where he is," Ai＊s mother added to the Associated Press, ※We really want this case to be dealt with as soon as possible and for the government to follow proper procedures in keeping with Chinese law.§








Management at the former palace of the Chinese emperors have been accused of hawking memberships to the club at for 1m yuan (almost ㏒92,600) each, offering exclusive access to the palace for international and Chinese millionaires.
Photographs posed on an anonymous microblog showed a table set with glittering crystal and silverware in the recently restored Jianfu Palace, which was once home to the great 18th century Emperor Qianlong.
Photographs of guards dressed in Imperial-era costumes were also shown lining the entrance to the Forbidden City, further fuelling resentment among online users.
China's rulers fret openly about threat of social unrest caused by rising wealth inequalities as ordinary working Chinese struggle to pay for food and housing while an elite few - often trading on political connections - reap massive rewards from China's economic miracle.
Bitter Chinese say that the clique of rich and powerful "500 families" that rule China, with their networks of cronies and hangers-on, increasingly resemble the Imperial Court with its gate-keeping eunuchs that was swept away by a series of revolutions after 1911.
The Forbidden City authorities had originally dismissed all reports of a "Billionaires Club", describing them as "pure nonsense", adding that the Jianfu Palace was used for "high-level events", much as major historic venues in Britain can be used for corporate hospitality.
"It is not, and could not, be used as a so-called top-class private club for rich people," added at statement on the Forbidden City's official blog last week.
However by Monday the Palace Museum was forced to admit that its commercial subsidiary, the Beijing Forbidden City Culture Development Company, had indeed offered the memberships "wrongly and without consultation" and that these were now being terminated pending a review.
The damage with the public had already been done, however, with a leading Chinese television anchor Rui Chenggang posting on his blog that scheme was a gross misuse of a building that Chinese consider to be the country's greatest national treasures.
"The total of 500 million yuan in entry fees alone is five times as much as the restoration cost of Jianfu Palace," wrote Mr Rui, a popular figure who campaigned successfully to oust a Starbucks coffee shop from the grounds of the Palace four years ago.
"A foreign tourist guide told me proudly that he has arranged a family dinner at the palace for an American billionaire. It is not a big deal if we lose several artefacts, but I am afraid we are losing something more valuable," he added.
Online users appeared to share Mr Rui's sentiments, scorning the Forbidden City management who are already under fire after a thief stole was allowed to steal more than ㏒1m-worth of gold jewellery boxes from a visiting exhibition last week.
"So the club build inside the Palace shall be blamed on a 'subordinate enterprise', and theft shall be blamed on thief," read one sarcastic comment on China's Netease portal, "Don't they know anything about what is happening under their noses? It's shameless." "The Forbidden City is the nation's treasure and it belongs to all Chinese people," added another, "How can they be allowed to use the national heritage to make money?"







The Panda, Ming Ming, died from old age and had kidney failure. She had been living at a zoo or preserve in Guangdong province, said The Global Times.
The China Panda Protection Center in Sichuan province said in a statement she died May 7, but it was reported only Tuesday in local media. More details on her were not available.
The newspaper said wild pandas live 15 years on average and captive ones 22 years.
Giant pandas are among the world's most endangered species, with about 1,600 in the wild. More than 300 are in captivity in China, most in a breeding program aimed at boosting the population. The country also loans pandas to zoos worldwide.
Ming Ming caused a minor diplomatic incident in 1991 when she was sent to London Zoo in 1991 to mate with Berlin panda Bao Bao. However she had to return to China when the two fought and failed to produce any cubs.








Liu Mingsuo, a farmer from the eastern province of Jiangsu, told China's state broadcaster that he couldn't sleep because he kept picturing his precious melons exploding in his field like "landmines".
"On May 7, I came out and counted 80 (bursting watermelons) but by the afternoon it was 100," said Mr Liu who told China Central TV that three acres of his melons had exploded. "Two days later I didn't bother to count anymore."
Agricultural experts said that the melons had been sprayed with "forchlorfenuron" 每 a legal additive that is also used in the United States 每 but that excessive quantities had been used in wet conditions to try and boost profits by getting the fruit to market early.
In theory China follows many internationally recognised standards for food safety but in practice these are frequently ignored. About 20 farmers and 45 acres of watermelon around the city of Danyang were affected, CCTV added.
China's government is increasingly nervous about food safety issues after a string of scandals that include melamine-tainted milk, toxic beansprouts, steroid-laced pork and meat that 'glows in the dark.
China's 'toxic milk' father sacks lawyers as appeal window expires 22 Nov 2010
In a rare move, the usually tightly-controlled state media has reportedly been encouraged to investigate and publicise food scandals in an attempt to hold unscrupulous and incompetent food producers to account.
In the latest report a Beijing resident found water turning red after she washed some spicy Sichuan peppers she had bought in her local market. The produce, which was dyed to "enhance" its appeal to shoppers, has now been sent away for testing, *China Daily* newspaper reported.










The death rates among HIV/Aids sufferers fell by 60 per cent when they were treated with anti-retroviral drugs, according to the study which was the first major assessment of a Chinese government scheme to hand out free anti-retroviral drugs.
China＊s government launched the scheme in 2002 in a bid to restore public confidence after a scandal involving blood donations for profit left at least 250,000 innocent people infected with HIV in the 1990s.
The study praised the impact of Chinese government efforts to combat the disease and showed ※the difference that can be made with high-level political commitment§, Hong Kong＊s department of health said in *The Lancet Infectious Diseases.* However despite the reaching nearly 100,000 Aids suffers, China still has an estimated 740,000 people infected with HIV-Aids of which less than half have even been formally diagnosed with the disease, according to the World Health Organisation.
Ray Yip, the director of the Gates Foundation in China and an international HIV-Aids expert, said the *Lancet *study was really aimed at sending a clear message to other countries that were slow with dealing with HIV-Aids.
※We＊ve known for 20 years that anti-retroviral drugs lower mortality rates, this isn＊t news. *The Lancet* must believe that it is important to send a message to other countries to follow China＊s example,§ he told *The Telegraph*.
※China is seen internationally as a late-responder to the Aids crisis and this is a clear example of what can be achieved.§ The authors of the study concede that despite the improvement, much more work needs to be done in China to improve Aids care.
※Given the size of the country, and the geographical spread of individuals with HIV＃China＊s treatment coverage is remarkable,§ said Professor Fujie Zhang from the National Centre for AIDS Control, ※But it is far from the goal of complete coverage of people who meet the treatment criteria.§ Dr Connie Osborne, the HIV program officer of the World Health Organisation in China, said that while a 60 per cent reduction in mortality was welcome, it still was not ※good enough§, since if AIDS sufferers were caught earlier, the figure could rise to 80 per cent or better.
※It is important to remember that the great majority of those people dying of HIV in China are still dying before they receive any antiretroviral drug treatment at all,§ she added.
Official Chinese government data shows that HIV-Aids has topped the list of deaths caused by notifiable infectious diseases every year since 2008, with nearly 80 per cent of those dying from HIV over the last five years receiving no anti-retroviral therapy.
International health experts in China say they would like to see an significant increase in the amount and effectiveness of screening for HIV-Aids in China in order to pick up sufferers before the develop full-blown Aids.
However the difficulties were illustrated by another report this week released by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) which showed how mainstream hospitals were routinely refusing to treat Aids sufferers.
One HIV-positive man interviewed for the report said that he was denied medical treatment for his back problem because of his HIV status in hospitals in Tianjin and Beijing and was forced to leave his job in a steel firm after his boss discovered he was infected.
※The doctor said at our hospital, many patients need surgery, and if other patients get infected, it will be a very bad thing,§ said the man, who declined to be identified.
※At the second hospital ... the doctor told me: ＊I sympathise with your suffering but because of your status, I dare not operate on you＊. I＊ve visited many other hospitals and encountered similar denials and excuses such as a lack of equipment.§










Dressed in her wedding gown, 22 year-old college student Miss Li, sat crying on the window ledge of a building in Changchun city.
Li threatened to jump from the apartment building she lived in, saying she could not live with the fact that her fianc谷 had left her and married another woman just days before their wedding.
Police called the distressed bride-to-be's mother and other relatives after Li dropped her bag containing her mobile phone from the building.
She was grabbed by community officer Guo Zhongfan who held Li by her neck and arms as she dangled above the street, while a man in the apartment below reached out of the window and pushed Li's feet up, as she was pulled to safety.
Li was sent to hospital following her rescue. Policemen and relatives were unable to contact Li's former fianc谷 by phone.

The attack on Fang Binxing 每 a figure popularly reviled by China's young tech-savvy elite 每 caused instant uproar and delight on the Chinese internet after the students posted an account of their protest on micro-blogging platforms.
The unusually daring protest comes as China's leaders move to tighten internet controls following the wave of Jasmine revolutions in the Middle East, and indicated the depths of frustration felt by some young Chinese towards the censorship.
Four students apparently sought out Mr Fang as he gave a talk at the Computer Sciences Department of Wuhan University in central China, pre-arming themselves with eggs purchased for the occasion at a nearby market, according to their own account on Twitter.
"I definitely hit Fang. As for whether there are pictures will depends on the two students," read a post by one of the students, @hanunyi, "I came by myself. It was not difficult to hit with my shoes but a little bit harder to target him really successfully." Another student, @zfangzhou apparently said the protest has been organised spontaneously after hearing word that Mr Fang was on the campus.
"It was not prepared in advance. We heard the news [of Mr Fang's presence] at noon. We then went to the agricultural market near the computer department. My friend bought eggs and went to scope out the place, where we meet @hanunyi
"We were are thinking of doing it ourselves and then unfortunately noticed that our professor was there and our graduate supervisor, and we immediately lost courage. Then we met @hanunyi, he was really courageous and did the thing directly." Photographs were also posted online purportedly showing the four holding the eggs that were allegedly thrown at Mr Fang and, later, the bare feet of @hanunyi after the protest which echoed that of an Iraqi journalist who hurled his shoes at George W Bush in Baghdad in December 2008.
The identity of @hanyunyi is unclear, however his Twitter account uses a picture of the jailed artist Ai Weiwei, with the sentence "If you don't want to release Ai Weiwei, then just pull me in too." Another photograph posted online appeared to show police or security guards at the scene, but messages posted on Twitter indicated the students had managed to leave the campus before being caught. Other students Tweeted that the police vans were on campus.
Police said they were seeking a man following the incident.
The protest is the first known physical attack on Mr Fang, however last December he was subjected to the virtual equivalent of an assault after online users discovered he had opened an account on Sina Weibo, the Chinese equivalent of Twitter.
Mr Fang, the principal of Beijing University of Posts & Telecommunications, was forced to close the account hours later after being deluged by thousands of incensed 'netizens' who left expletive-laden messages denouncing him as an agent of repression.
China has some of the harshest censorship rules in the world, blocking many overseas sites such as Twitter, Facebook and YouTube and spending billions of pounds and man-hours policing the internet for information deemed to be inimical to the ideal of a "harmonious society".
The attack on Mr Fang sent the censors scrambling to delete jubilant posts on Weibo in which online users offered to shower gifts on the two protestors from expensive meals to cash prizes, with one user even offering herself to the 'heroes'.
When censors at Sina Weibo were forced to declare searches for "Fang Binxing" illegal, the irony was not lost on many users. "Kind of poetic, really," observed one Twitter user, "The blocker, blocked."
When an account of the protest was posted on China's Netease web portal by a blogger using an alias, other online users rushed to offer "prizes".
One promised the use of a luxury flat in Shanghai for three months - worth GBP3,000 每 while another offered the students "10 VPNs" - the relatively costly Virtual Proxy Network software used by students to "leap the Wall" and circumvent internet censorship.
"I offer a package of tourist tickets for Suzhou gardens to those who hit Fang successfully," said another, while a third from the US, said "I offer a pair of Nike shoes to the one that threw his smelly shoes at Fang."
Michael Anti, a veteran Chinese journalist and blogger who has campaigned for free speech in China, said the reaction of China's online users to the stunt showed how deeply many resented Chinese internet controls.
"The netizens were happy to see this scene. The Great Firewall not only blocks political content, but also prevents the most intelligent minds in China getting useful, up-to-date information from the outside world in science, technology, and other non-political spheres.
"We Chinese have now become second-class citizens in the Internet Age. A whole generation is suffering from the lack of freedom of information, and definitely, Fang should be blamed for this."
The idea for the protest appears to have been originally planted by a Hong Kong-based activist and freelance writer Jia Jia, who posted Mr Fang＊s whereabouts online at around 11am and urged students go prepared to show their displeasure towards him.
※All persons with lofty ideas are welcomed to be present,§ wrote the activist, ※The host won＊t offer tomatoes, horse sh*t, 50 cent coins, rotten eggs, etc, so students please prepare them by yourselves.§
Mr Jia said he was surprised at the students＊ response to his post which was re-Tweeted on student bulletin boards, but said the reaction showed the high levels of anger among the students at internet controls.
※It reflected their dissatisfaction about current internet controls and it showed people＊s willingness to make an effort and pay a cost to break down internet controls,§ Mr Jia said in a phone interview with The Telegraph.
Concerns were mounting last night about what would now happen to @hanunyi who is a student at the Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, according to Mr Jia, who said he feared he would be charged with causing a disturbance.
Isaac Mao, the man who wrote China＊s first blog in 2002, said he had exchanged several direct messages with @hanunyi via Twitter immediately after the incident, said he was now concerned for the protestor.
※He sent a message after this happened saying that he felt this was something he needed to do, that he had not prepared it in advance, but he said he had not been at all prepared for the strength of the netizens＊ response,§ Mr Mao told The Telegraph.
※This is China. There could be two very different responses by the authorities. They could be lenient, and play the episode down so that more people do not learn about it, or they could not.§







When Louis Vuitton get the decorators in, they don't compromise on style. And what better way to conceal a bit of dust and unsightly scaffolding than with a monogrammed, mock-trunk cover measuring 20 metres high and four metres wide?
However the well-dressed solution has not pleased district officials in the Chinese city of Shanghai. The iconic trunk structure is considered to be an advertisement, and as such, it violates the city's regulations, which state that outdoor billboards must be no higher than nine metres tall.
Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell back on the catwalk for Louis Vuitton
Local residents in the wealthy district told the Shanghai Daily that the huge trunk is a danger to public safety because it takes up too much pavement space, forcing pedestrians to walk on the road.

Today, workers were seen dismantling the cover to the dismay of the French luxury house, founded in 1854.

In a week-long visit to the United States, Chen Bingde, People's Liberation Army Chief of General Staff, struck a mostly conciliatory tone, saying his country had no plans to take on the US military in the Pacific.
"I can tell you China does not have the capability to challenge the United States," Mr Chen told a joint news conference with his US counterpart, Admiral Mike Mullen.
In the first trip to the United States by a PLA chief of staff in seven years, US officials hoped the visit will help pave the way for better defence ties.
"We share a broad consensus on some major issues. Certainly we also disagree on some other issues," he said through an interpreter.
Mr Chen acknowledged that the main source of friction was over Taiwan.
When asked by a reporter if US weapons sales to Taiwan would affect military ties between the two economic powers, he said: "My answer is affirmative. It will."
"As to how bad the impact will be, it will depend on the nature of the weapons sold to Taiwan," he said.
The general said the arms sales amounted to US meddling in the "domestic" affairs of another country, an approach that he described as "hegemonic."
In a speech earlier, he made a pointed reference to Abraham Lincoln, president during the 1861-1865 US civil war, for "defending American sovereignty and territorial integrity."
Mr Chen said that in his talks with US politicians, some members of Congress agreed that it was time to repeal legislation that calls for arms sales to Taiwan.
China suspended defence ties last year with the United States after Washington announced more than $6 billion in weapons sales to Taiwan. Beijing considers Taiwan - where the mainland's defeated nationalists fled in 1949 - to be a territory awaiting reunification
For his part, Admiral Mullen said there were no plans to halt the arms sales as they were mandated by US law.
"As long as that law remains in effect, certainly we will follow it," he said.
The two countries' views were "not always aligned" but more contacts between officers in both armies would help avoid misunderstandings, he said.
The military chiefs, in a statement issued a day after talks, said they had agreed to communicate through a US-China telephone hotline and to hold joint counter-piracy exercises in the Gulf of Aden.
The two officers also pledged to hold more military exchanges.
Mr Chen, in his speech at National Defense University in Washington, sought to reassure an audience of American officers about China's military buildup amid concerns that Beijing is seeking to roll back American influence in the Pacific.
"The world does not need to worry about, let alone fear, China's growth," he said.
China "never intends to challenge the US" and welcomes its role in the Asia-Pacific region, he said.
While China's military had improved markedly in recent years, it still lags far behind the United States, he said.
Chen said he had extended an invitation to his counterpart, Admiral Mullen, to pay a similar visit to China.
When US Defense Secretary Robert Gates paid a high-profile visit to Beijing in January, the Chinese military upstaged Gates with an inaugural test flight of the country's J-20 stealth fighter.












The decision to institute a fleet-wide flag upgrade comes amid reports that the PLA Navy is preparing to conduct sea trials of its first aircraft carrier, which is expected to be put into service as early as the end of this year.
Although the design will remain the same, the new flags will be bigger and less drab than the old ones, according to a report in the People's Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of the Chinese armed forces.
"The size and configuration of the current naval ensign was regulated and released into use in the 1950s and is not commensurate with the tonnage of new-generation vessels and the Navy's increasing engagement with the state's foreign affairs," the paper reported.
The PLA has not released the percentage increase in size of the flags, saying only that it would now meet "international standards".
The design 每 a red flag atop blue and white naval stripes, with a yellow star, denoting the Communist Party, and the Chinese characters for "eight" and "one", commemorating the PLA's founding on August 1 1927 每 will remain unchanged.
China is currently spending billions of dollars upgrading its armed forces, including the creation of a blue-water navy that can protect China's global interests which have grown rapidly as China goes overseas to secure raw materials for its economic miracle.
Analysts say that China has plans to build up to five aircraft carriers flotillas 每 three conventional and two nuclear-powered 每 by 2020, with some reports saying that preparations to build China's first indigenous carrier have already begun in Shanghai's Changxingdao shipyard.
China is currently refurbishing a 66,000 ton Soviet-era Kuznetsov class carrier, the Varyag, which it bought from Ukraine and will re-christen the Shi Lang, after a 17th century Chinese general who conquered what is now Taiwan in 1861.
Officially, China will not comment on its carrier program. Last month the PLA held its first ever regular press conference, but when asked about the Varyag, the spokesman said he had "no information" on the ship.










The eight pro-democracy activists claim violations of the US Constitution and, according to the plaintiffs' lawyer, in a lawsuit that is the first of its kind.
In an unorthodox move it names not only a company but also the Chinese government as defendants.
The lawsuit was filed more than a year after Google Inc declared it would no longer censor search results in China, and rerouted internet users to its Hong Kong website.
Baidu spokesman Kaiser Kuo declined to comment.
China's Foreign Ministry, when asked about the lawsuit, said that China "guarantees Chinese citizens' freedom of expression according to the law".
"The way the Chinese government manages the Internet in accordance with the law accords with international norms and is a sovereign matter," ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu told a regular news briefing in Beijing.
"According to international law, foreign courts have no jurisdiction."
According to the complaint filed in the US District Court in Manhattan, Baidu acts as an "enforcer" of policies by the ruling Communist Party in censoring such pro-democracy content as references to the 1989 Tiananmen Square military crackdown.
This censorship suppresses the writings and videos of the plaintiffs to the extent that the materials do not appear in search results, the complaint said.
It also violates US laws because the censorship affects searches here, according to the complaint.
"We allege a private company is acting as the arm and agent of a foreign state to suppress political speech, and permeate US borders to violate the First Amendment," Stephen Preziosi, the lawyer for the plaintiffs, said in an interview.
Mr Preziosi said the alleged censorship also violates federal and New York civil rights laws, as well as New York's human rights law, on the grounds that "an internet search engine is a public accommodation, just like a hotel or restaurant".
The lawsuit seeks $16 million in damages, or $2 million per plaintiff, but does not seek changes to Baidu's policies.
China's internet censorship practices are viewed as reflecting its belief that keeping a tight grip on information helps the government maintain control. There have been mounting concerns in China that open dissent on the internet could contribute to destabilising the country.








leaders espouse a doctrine of "non-interference" in other nations' affairs and take every opportunity to reassure the watching world of its "peaceful rise", notwithstanding its rapid military modernisation programmes.
However in the last 12 months China has crossed several significant milestones that analysts say mark a growing self-confidence that Chinese armed forces can now begin to match the country's status as a rising economic super-power.
March 2011: China deploys one of its most advanced missile frigates, Xuzhou, off the coast of Libya to assist in the evacuation of its nationals caught up in the emerging civil war. China also deploys four Ilyushin Il-76 military planes to evacuate stranded citizens. Analysts point out that 20 years ago, in 1991, China had relied on the state-owned shipping company COSCO to evacuate citizens caught up in the implosion of Somalia.
March 2011: A Chinese missile frigate, Ma'Anshan, escorts a World Food Program ship along the pirate-infested coast of Somalia in another milestone for the Chinese military. The deployment is hailed as evidence of China's growing willingness to shoulder international responsibilities.
September 2010: Chinese Air Force sends four H-6H bombers and two J-10 aircraft to take part a Shanghai Co-operation Organisation (SCO) exercise in Kazakhstan. The aircraft return to base in China, but the "simulated cross-border strikes" were the first by the Chinese Air Force, according to the official Xinhua news agency
September 2010: China sends four helicopters to the Pakistan province of Sindh to assist flood victims, in what analysts say is the first active deployment of Chinese air forces helicopter assets overseas. The mission wins plaudits for its logistical accomplishment.
October 2010: China sends several Russian-origin Su-27 fighter-jets to participate in a joint military exercise with Turkey, refueling in Iran en route. This was first ever such exercise with a NATO ally. Turkish media reports US anger over the decision to invite China.











"Kim Jong-un has passed the border by train early Friday to visit China with his uncle, Jang Song-thaek, to meet with Chinese high officials," the Chosun Ilbo newspaper quoted an unnamed diplomatic source as saying.
Reclusive North Korea is preparing for a third generation of Kim family rule, with the young and inexperienced Kim poised to take over from his father Kim Jong-il as the autocratic state's next leader.
The 27 or 28-year-old Kim is taking the next big step to succeeding leader Kim Jong-il by visiting China, introducing himself to the destitute North's main benefactor, possibly one of the most crucial diplomatic moves he will ever make.
Yonhap news agency said it was unclear where he was heading in China.
South Korean government officials could not immediately confirm the reports.
The youngest of the leader's three sons, little is known about Kim, not even his age. He was most likely born in 1984.
Educated in Switzerland, he is thought to speak English and German, and bears a striking resemblance to his grandfather, the North's founder Kim Il-sung.
Analysts say two attacks on the peninsula last year, which killed 50 South Koreans, were aimed at winning the army's support for a continuation of dynastic rule and underscored an intent to maintain the state's military-first policy.
Experts say the young Kim will likely follow the same militaristic path, maintaining a strong grip over one of the world's largest armies and pressing on with a nuclear weapons programme in the face of international outrage.
Kim Jong-il last year promoted Jang, his brother-in-law, to the powerful National Defence Commission, which many analysts took to be an attempt to establish a mechanism for the eventual transfer of power, with Jang as kingmaker.







For centuries, the impoverished farmers of Ningxia have grown watermelons and berries on the fertile flood plains of the Yellow river.
But now they are switching to grow Pinot Noir and Chardonnay grapes after Moet Hennessy, the makers of Dom Perignon and Krug, signed a deal to create China＊s first-ever ※Champagne§.
The world＊s best-known Champagne brand will plant 163 acres of vines in Ningxia, which lies just south of the Mongolian steppe and the Gobi desert and whose population is one-third Muslim. The tiny region is China＊s third-poorest and its farmers earn less than ㏒2,000 a year.
Moet is hoping its Chinese bubbly, which will sell under its Chandon label, will slake the country＊s growing thirst for wine and other luxury goods. The first bottles will be ready in three years, a spokesman said. ※This will be the first sparkling wine in China made according to traditional methods.§ Moet has also recently announced a similar plan in India, where its ※Nashik Chandon§ sparkling wine is currently ageing in cellars and will be released next year.
Only wines from the eponymous region of France can be labelled Champagne, but Moet＊s experts said the soil and climate of Ningxia closely match the terroir of Rheims, even if the placid waters of the Marne have been swapped for the muddy and often turbulent Yellow river.
Moet＊s Chinese fizz will be produced by the company＊s experts at purpose-built winery jointly owned with a local state-owned agriculture company, Ningxia Nongken, who boasted that the French house had picked them from nine other possible partners. A spokesman for Ningxia Nongken said planting would begin next April or May.
Moet has not revealed the cost of its Chinese sparkling wine, but it will be significantly cheaper that it＊s imported Champagne which attracts heavy duties, selling on the mainland for at least ㏒45 a bottle.
※This move shows how serious the big Champagne houses are now about breaking into China,§ said Nick Pegna, director of Berry Bros. & Rudd wine merchants in Hong Kong, ※This wine will have lower duties and will help educate a whole new demographic of wine consumers.§
China currently drinks around one million bottles of Champagne a year but the market is growing rapidly and Champagne producers are desperate to establish a firm foothold in a market that has been compared to America a century ago. ※Having a local brand is a long-term strategy that will allow Moet to capture people who cannot afford Champagne now but will progress up through the range of brands and eventually drink Champagne,§ added Mr Pegna.
Although most Chinese still prefer to drink beer and ※baijiu§ 每 the country＊s fiery grain spirit - China＊s wine consumption more than doubled between 2005 and 2009 to more than 1bn bottles a year, according to the analysts International Wine and Spirit Research (IWSR). Stories abound 每 some perhaps apocryphal 每 of newly-minted Chinese millionaires mixing Chateau Lafite-Rothschild with Coca-Cola, or holding lavish parties where the great vintages of the 1970s and 1980s are tipped together into silver punch bowls. Their seemingly boundless appetite for the best French wines has seen Hong Kong merchants reporting some Chinese writing ※blank cheques§ to get their hands on the top vintages.
Meanwhile, China＊s own wine production is set to double in the next four years, according to IWSR, and is increasing in quality. This week, a Chinese Bordeaux-style red wine called ※Jia Bei Lan§, also grown in Ningxia, won the award for ※Red Middle East, Far East & Asia over ㏒10§ at the Decanter World Wine Awards in London.









Xavier de Eizaguirre, who manages Chateau Mouton Rothschild, one of France＊s five ※Premier Cru§ estates, said it has been a ※huge struggle to stay fair§ to his customers. ※When the Chinese are willing to buy your entire year＊s production, it is difficult to resist,§ he said.
The five Premier Cru estates, which also include Chateau Lafite Rothschild, Chateau Margaux, Chateau Latour and Chateau Haut-Brion, produce just 180,000 bottles to 200,000 bottles of wine each year, and there is only so much to go around.
※Obviously as a company we want to follow the market,§ said Mr de Eizaguirre. ※We have to take the opportunity to do business. After the financial crisis, of course we want to actually sell our products. But we have to be very careful with our traditional customers in the United Kingdom and Europe,§ he added. ※After all, one day we might get kicked out of China and then, when we return to our old customers, they will ask us why we deserted them when they needed us.§
With hordes of Chinese millionaires hunting down ※icon§ wine for their cellars, the prices of Premier Cru wines have tripled or quadrupled on the mainland in the past year.
Asian buyers now account for 60pc of Sotheby＊s wine sales globally and in 2010 a case of Chateau Lafite 2009, en primeur, sold for ㏒43,000 in Hong Kong, three times the London price. A case of Lafite which sold for ㏒2,500 ten years ago in New York or London now fetches as much as ㏒37,000.
The solution, said Mr de Eizaguirre, may well be to make more wine in China. ※There is no doubt that lots of people will invest [in Chinese vineyards],§ he said. ※We have looked at several options over the past ten years, but it is a risk. When you invest in a vineyard, you are doing it for the next generation, it is very capital intensive,§ he said.
※That＊s a sticking point at the moment, but sooner or later, we will do it. I do not see any suggestion the market will not continue to grow strongly.§









Chinese wine has been long derided within the industry as cheap plonk, with many producers simply adding alcohol and red dye to water, or buying container loads of cheap wine from Europe and mixing it together.
However, the 200 judges at the Decanter awards described the 2009 Bordeaux blend called Jia Beilan, made by Helan Qingxue, as "supple, graceful and ripe, but not flashy". They gave it top prize in the Middle East, Far East & Asia category for red wines over ㏒10.
"India and China remain winemaking countries with their doors and windows completely wide open to all sorts of competing ideas 每 both outside and inside the country," said Ch'ng Poh Tiong, the chairman of the judging panel, in the latest Decanter magazine.








China first started making wine from grapes more than 4,600 years ago but modern wine production started in 1892 when Zhang Bishi, a Chinese diplomat, imported some 500,000 vines to start a vineyard in Yantai. His company, now called Changyu Pioneer wine, is thought to be the 10th largest winery in the world.
In 1980, as China began to open up again after years of self-imposed isolation, Remy Martin set up a joint-venture in Tianjin called the Dynasty Wine company, which was at the time only the second-ever joint venture partnership. The company now has over 90 brands.
In 2000, the Chinese market for wine began to boom and by 2005, 90 per cent of grapes grown in China were for domestic wine. Berry Brothers and Rudd, the wine broker, has predicted that Chinese wine will rival Bordeaux for quality within 50 years.
At the moment, three giants dominate the market: Changyu, Great Wall and Dynasty. Between 2001 and 2006 the wine market grew by 68 per cent. The largest producing region is Yantai-Penglai, with more than 140 wineries producing 40 per cent of China's wine.
Around 90 per cent of wine drunk in China is red.








The Beijing Fake Cultural Development company, a holding company for the artist's studio, "was found to have evaded 'a huge amount' of tax", said Xinhua, the official government news agency, quoting an unnamed police official.
Xinhua added that Mr Ai, who has only been visited once by his family since he disappeared around six weeks ago, was under "residential surveillance" and that his "right to meet with people who live with him was ensured in accordance with the law".
Officials have already indicated that they were investigating possible financial crimes committed by Mr Ai. However, his family said he had been targeted because of his political activism.
Mr Ai's wife has laughed off the suggestion that he evaded taxes, saying that she was in charge of the accounts and should be arrested.
Meanwhile, the official accountant of the Beijing Fake Developemnt company also went missing in April, as did Mr Ai's driver and cousin Zhang Jinsong, his friend Wen Tao and colleague Liu Zhenggang.
The Chinese Foreign ministry has denied that Mr Ai's detention is connected in any way to his work on human rights.










The blast rocked the plant of a Foxconn subsidiary in Chengdu, capital of southwest China's Sichuan province, early on Friday evening, the official Xinhua news agency quoted a spokesman for the city government as saying.
The 16 injured workers were rushed to hospital where three of them are being treated for serious injuries, he said.
An official with Chengdu police said the cause of the blast was under investigation, according to Xinhua.
Anonymous Foxconn employees told the Economic Observer newspaper that it was probably a dust explosion, which can happen when powdered combustible material is concentrated in an enclosed space.
The report said the iPad 2 was being made in the building hit by the blast. The workers were quoted as saying that several hundred people were on shift there at the time of the accident.
The local government and the Chengdu fire brigade's spokesman were not immediately available for comment when contacted by AFP.
It is the latest incident to hit the embattled Foxconn, after at least 13 of its employees died in apparent suicides last year, which activists blamed on tough working conditions.
Foxconn is the world's largest maker of computer components and produces items for Apple, Sony and Nokia. It employs about one million workers in China, about half of them based in its main facility in the southern city of Shenzhen.
Foxconn has been expanding its workforce in other parts of China as it seeks to scale back the size of its Shenzhen plant.
The firm opened the two-billion-dollar Chengdu plant in October last year, according to Xinhua.
Calls to a Foxconn spokesmen in Taiwan rang unanswered on Friday night.











The explosion rocked Foxconn's Chengdu manufacturing facility late yesterday. Local reports said it happened in the building where Foxconn keeps the iPad 2 production line.
Foxconn, best known as a supplier of Apple＊s iPhone and iPad, has already come under pressure in the past 18 months, after more than 13 factory workers committed suicide. Critics say the company＊s employees are subjected to harsh working conditions, long hours and low pay.
※We are working closely with Foxconn at this point to understand what caused this terrible event,§ said Steve Dowling, a spokesman for California-based Apple. ※We are deeply saddened by the tragedy."
The explosion is understood to have hit the polishing plant, which is at the end of the assembly process.
Foxconn representatives have confirmed two deaths and 16 injuries from the incident, with three of the injuries reported as serious.
The $2bn (㏒1.2bn) laptop-producing plant where the explosion took place opened in October.
According to Chinese reports, police in Chengdu said their preliminary conclusion was that the explosion wasn＊t caused intentionally.
Foxconn is the world's largest maker of computer components and produces items for Apple, Dell, Hewlett-Packard,Sony and Nokia. It employs about 1m people in China, about half of them based in its main facility in the southern city of Shenzhen.
Foxconn has been expanding its workforce into other parts of China as it seeks to scale back the size of its Shenzhen plant.











In a practice known as "leaping the Wall" that is usually the preserve of tech-savvy Chinese students, 78-year-old Gao Ying has been employing sophisticated Virtual Proxy Network (VPN) software on her computer.
The technology is essential to keep track of Ai Weiwei's well-wishers and campaigners who use social networking sites such as Facebook, Twitter and YouTube which are all banned by China's so-called 'net nannies'.
"She told me she bought a computer not long ago and learned how to surf internet and how to 'fanqiang' (cross the Great Firewall)," Liu Xiaoyuan, a lawyer and family friend said on his microblog after visiting the family in Beijing.
Ai, a fierce critic of China's government and the creators of last year's Tate Modern exhibition Sunflower Seeds, has now been in detention for 50 days without access to any legal representation.
Gao Ying, who is hard of hearing and highly stressed and exhausted by her son's detention, told *The Telegraph* a week ago how she had feared that Ai had been tortured after rumours circulated online. She was too tired to come to the phone on Monday.
Fears that Ai was being physically mistreated were eventually allayed after Ai's wife, Lu Qing, was allowed to her husband for 20 minutes after he had been in custody for 43 days without any word to the outside world.
However Ai's family say they remain frustrated at the legal limbo in which Ai and his associates are now apparently trapped.
"We cannot even appoint a lawyer because we still have not received official notification of any charges. We know only what we read on Xinhua," Ai's sister Gao Ge told The Telegraph, "We want this case to be handled openly and transparently and want to be notified as soon as possible." At least four other associates 每 his driver, company accountant, designer and a journalist-friend 每 have also been held cut off from the outside world as China's authorities investigate what the state news agency Xinhua reports to be "tax evasion" charges.
Friends, family and supporters say such charges are politically motivated, and even if true, do not justify the manner in which Ai has been held, with such scant regard for due process and natural justice.
Under Chinese law Ai can be held for six months under 'house surveillance' without access to a lawyer, but usually in such circumstances he should also be able to receive phone-calls and family visits, according to lawyers.
The family and their supporters are also extremely concerned about the status of Ai's four associates who were scooped up by the state security apparatus up within hours of Ai's detention at Beijing Airport on April 3.
They fear that the four associates of Ai's Fake Design studio 每 accountant Hu Mingfen, friend and former journalist Wen Tao, driver Zhang Jinsong and design consultant Liu Zhenggang 每 are being held to build the case against Ai.
"It it is possible that they want these employees to be witnesses or to 'confess' against Ai," added Ms Gao, "we need transparency and details of any case as soon as possible."







The emergency services found the vehicle on its roof five metres down a ravine after a collision with a car. The coach's windows were crushed, leaving passengers trapped in the footwells.
Three men and a woman were cut free from the inside of the bus, which had to be raised to free a passenger trapped at the back.
All four were taken to hospital for treatment.









So perhaps it is no surprise that he stepped away from a tour of China's top factories and solar panel plants earlier this week to try and find some salad dressing at a local supermarket.
The 69-year-old leader of North Korea slipped out of his suite at the Yangzhou State Guest House at around four o'clock on Monday afternoon and strolled for five minutes to the Suguo supermarket.
Kim, who is a known gourmet, reportedly then accosted one sales clerk and asked "Where can I find oil for a salad?"
Good olive oil is, of course, hard to come by in North Korea, where the World Food Programme said in March there were more than six million people on the brink of starvation and requiring urgent food aid.
The WFP estimates that some 475,000 tons of food are needed, and Mr Kim was thought to be meeting Hu Jintao, the president of China, to discuss some of the problems on wednesday, as well as a resumption of talks over North Korea's nuclear disarmament.
China remains North Korea's closest ally and the provider of significant amounts of food aid.
Mr Kim's appetite, meanwhile, has been the subject of several legends, including that he likes to have his sashimi carved from a live fish and that he hates anchovies on his pizza.
According to one of his chefs, Mr Kim sends trusted couriers to fetch him back Danish bacon, Iranian caviar and Thai mangos. A nephew of his first wife, meanwhile, relates that the Dear Leader likes to have his rice cooked over wood that has been cut down from Mount Paektu, Korea's sacred mountain.
There is even an institute in Pyongyang devoted to making sure Mr Kim eats only the healthiest produce.
But while the North Korean leader paid special attention to the rice and oil in the supermarket, which closed at 1.30pm especially for him, he came away empty-handed. He went on to board his special train before heading to Nanjing and then to Beijing.









The first blast went off in the car park of the Fuzhou public prosecutor＊s office just after nine o＊clock this morning, as workers were arriving for the day.
Two other bombs went off in the following 30 minutes, one at the Linchuan district government building and another at the local pharmaceutical drug administration bureau.
The three buildings were within walking distance of each other and two of the bombs were left inside cars parked outside.
According to Xinhua, the state news agency, three of the six injured are critical. The bombings were initially blamed on a local farmer who was said to be upset at the progress of a court case, but Xinhua later said the cause of the attacks was still under investigation.
However, the coordination of the blasts and the use of car bombs pointed to a more sophisticated attacker, or group of attackers. ※One farmer? Only if he was a member of al Qaeda,§ said one comment on the Chinese internet.
Pictures posted on the internet showed an enormous mushroom cloud of smoke rising up outside one of the buildings and injured men lying prone on the ground. At least ten buildings were destroyed at the Linchuan government building, which is also the site of the city＊s petitions office.
Under Chinese law, anyone with a grievance against the government can take it to the petitions office. Consequently, these offices are frequently the scene of confrontations with the authorities.
"According to witnesses, almost all the windows up to the eighth floor of the public prosecutor＊s building were broken,§ said Xinhua.

Two other bombs went off in the following 30 minutes, one at the Linchuan district government building and another at the local pharmaceutical drug administration bureau.
The three buildings were within walking distance of each other and two of the bombs were left inside cars parked outside.
According to Xinhua, the state news agency, three of the six injured are critical. The bombings were initially blamed on a local farmer who was said to be upset at the progress of a court case, but Xinhua later said the cause of the attacks was still under investigation.
However, the coordination of the blasts and the use of car bombs pointed to a more sophisticated attacker, or group of attackers. ※One farmer? Only if he was a member of al Qaeda,§ said one comment on the Chinese internet.
Pictures posted on the internet showed an enormous mushroom cloud of smoke rising up outside one of the buildings and injured men lying prone on the ground. At least ten buildings were destroyed at the Linchuan government building, which is also the site of the city＊s petitions office.
Under Chinese law, anyone with a grievance against the government can take it to the petitions office. Consequently, these offices are frequently the scene of confrontations with the authorities.
"According to witnesses, almost all the windows up to the eighth floor of the public prosecutor＊s building were broken,§ said Xinhua.

A 54-year-old prisoner at the Jixi labour camp in the northern province of Heilongjiang said he was forced to play games on the internet in order to build up credit that was traded by his guards for real money, a practice known as ※gold-farming§.
In many online games, such as the enormously popular World of Warcraft, players who spend hours accumulating gold inside the game then sell their achievements to other players who do not have the time or patience to earn their own online currency.
Although the practice is technically illegal, it is widespread. Typically, players in developing countries sell their gold to players in the United States or Europe.
In an interview with the Guardian, the prisoner said online gaming was a far more lucrative activity for the managers of the labour camp than the physical labour the inmates were forced to do.
"Prison bosses made more money forcing inmates to play games than they do forcing people to do manual labour," he said. "There were 300 prisoners forced to play games. We worked 12-hour shifts in the camp.
I heard them say they could earn 5,000-6,000rmb (㏒470-570) a day. We didn't see any of the money. The computers were never turned off."
He added: "If I couldn't complete my work quota, they would punish me physically. They would make me stand with my hands raised in the air and after I returned to my dormitory they would beat me with plastic pipes. We kept playing until we could barely see things.§
However, an official at the central office for labour camps in Heilongjiang denied that inmates were forced to play games online. ※I have never heard of this. If you want to see for yourself, come to one of our labour camps,§ he said.
The official, who declined to give his name, said: ※We do not allow our inmates to do high-risk occupations, such as coal-mining. We do not have large numbers of computers. And we do not allow our prisoners to have any contact with the outside world. If they were playing these online games they could easily communicate with other people. We would never allow that.§
According to figures from the China Internet Centre, nearly ㏒1.2bn of make- believe currencies were traded in China in 2008 and the number of gamers who play to earn and trade credits are on the rise.
It is estimated that 80 per cent of all gold farmers are in China and with the largest internet population in the world there are thought to be 100,000 full-time gold farmers in the country.












From a runner-bean spotted spiralling along the balcony balustrade of a Beijing apartment, to long waiting-lists for allotments, a plethora of gardening websites and a mushrooming of organic farms and shops, Chinese families are increasingly looking to "grow their own".
In recent years China has been hit by a number of food scandals and fears about safety have lingered. In 2008, 300,000 babies became seriously ill and six babies died after being given formula contaminated with the industrial chemical melamine. In April this year, police seized 40 tons of beansprouts which had been treated with dangerous growth promoting chemicals and hormones, while this month, watermelons started exploding in the fields because they had been treated with too much accelerant.
In March health officials discovered pork that glowed and iridescent blue in the dark because it had been contaminated by a bacteria.
Amid the scares it was reported that China's government departments were running their own organic farms to feed staff, sparking criticism that officials were putting their own safety before that of the people.
"There are serious concerns about food safety these days, so we decided to give it a go," says Yu Luping, a 74-year-old retired teacher, lovingly watering a tray of lettuce seedlings on the balcony of her 13th floor apartment just off Beijing's second ring-road.
"This way we can both beautify the apartment with something green and know that at least some our vegetables are safe to eat. I'm new to all this, but if it works I'm going to try beans, tomatoes and even some peppers next year." Mrs Yu is one of 80 families in her block of flats who have started to experiment with balcony-gardening after posters appeared in her compound exhorting residents to grow their own veg 每 "fresh, healthy and with no pollution!"
"People have always planted flowers on their balconies, but now they see planting vegetables still covers their balcony in foliage but also gives them fresh food to eat," said Guo Rongjuan, a worker at a Beijing-based social group responsible for the poster campaign.
"People are concerned about food safety now and interest is growing all the time. After our scheme balcony vegetable scheme was reported in the local paper, the phones have not stopped ringing." On a larger scale, organic farmers and a host of co-operative schemes that lease small parcels of land to urbanites who want to feel the soil under their fingernails 每 not unlike British allotment schemes 每 report business is suddenly booming.
Peng Xunan, the founder of the "Farmlander" allotment scheme that has 200 sites across China said the plots were being rented in ever-growing numbers, and no longer just be pensioners looking to occupy their time.
"I'd say it was split three ways between families who want to teach their children where food comes from, older people in their retirement, but in recent months definitely a growing number worried about food safety concerns after all these reports of lax food safety," he said.
Wang Yanzong, 75, a retired worker from China's national power company who was out tending his vegetables on one of hundreds of immaculate allotments at the Sunhome gated community on the outskirts of Beijing.
"When we came here in 2007 many of the plots weren't even taken, now there is a waiting list because gardening has become so popular," he said.










Edinburgh Zoo unveiled plans for the ㏒250,000 state-of-the-art enclosure being built for the pair, called Tian Tian and Yang Guang, ahead of their arrival from China later this year.
Among the other features of their new home, the zoo＊s former gorilla house, will be a bamboo forest, a small cave suitable for sleeping, climbing frames and paddling pools to cool themselves.
There will also be a fully-fitted kitchen for keepers to prepare food, a hospital for dealing with any emergencies, a birthing area and the nursery.
The public will be able to view the pandas at close quarters from either a split-level, glass-fronted walkway or a number of webcams that will broadcast live footage over the internet.
However, one area where it is hoped the pandas can get some privacy is the tunnel running between their two enclosures. They are notoriously solitary animals and their breeding season lasts only between two and seven days from March to May.
Marty Hall, the zoo＊s facilities manager, said: ※The tunnel means that they can meet up at controlled times and there are enough areas away from the public where they can go and hide away together.§
Both pandas are being lent to Britain for 10 years, although it is expected that any offspring they produce during that period will be returned to China shortly after birth.
The last pandas in the UK, Ming Ming and Bao Bao, were shipped out in 1994 after failing to mate. Only nine zoos outside China currently house the animals, three of which are in Europe.
Edinburgh Zoo is expecting to double its visitor numbers after their arrival, which followed five years of negotiations at the highest political and diplomatic levels.
Tian Tian, a female, and Yangguang, a male, were both born in 2003 and are currently housed at Wolong Panda Breeding Centre in China＊s Sichuan Province, which is home to 250 breeding giant pandas.
However, the animals＊ low sex drive means only 20 panda cubs are born in captivity every year around the world. Both Edinburgh＊s new pandas have produced offspring previously, but not with each other.
It is expected the animals will eat between 110lb (50kg) and 154lb (70kg) of bamboo a day and their upkeep will be funded through sponsorship.
The zoo has recently been hit with controversy after two senior executives were suspended and a third official dismissed. Donald Emslie, the zoo＊s chairman, resigned at an emergency general meeting earlier this month.








Corporate sponsorship is part of life for universities in the UK or the United States, which regularly raise hundreds of millions of pounds from donors.
And as Chinese universities race to transform themselves into world-class institutions, they are increasingly looking outwards for funding.
But Tsinghua university's decision to rename its No. 4 Teaching Building, in large gold letters, as the Jeanswest Building seems to have crossed a line.
The university, which is the alma mater of Hu Jintao, the Chinese president, saw the new sign defaced with spray paint within days, while students took to the internet to denounce the greed of their administration.
"This name has made Tsinghua a laughing stock," said one internet commenter. "I feel that the Tsinghua spirit has been sold at a low price," added a student named Zhang Jinyuan to the South China Morning Post.
The scandal even drew a slap on the wrist for Tsinghua from China's Education ministry, which commented that the university could find "a more suitable way" to express its thanks for sponsorship.
The nameplate has now been taken down, and is unlikely to reappear.
Huang Jianhua, the deputy director of the university's Education Foundation, said the name had been removed to avoid any further embarrassment to the university and the sponsor.
Jeanswest, a popular Australian brand that is now owned by a Hong Kong company, said it understood the situation and would "continue to support education in many ways".
Tsinghua is in the middle of a 750 million yuan (㏒70 million) fund raising effort and has offered the naming rights to 14 of its buildings. Other buildings have been named after a Taiwanese shoemaker and an advertising company.
In 2001, students at Oxford university protested at the naming of the Said Business School after a ㏒23 million donation from Wafic Said, who advised on defence contracts between the UK and Saudi Arabia.











The volume of water in Poyang lake in Jiangxi province, normally 100 miles-long and 10 miles-wide, is now a tenth of its normal level, according to Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency.
Fishing boats and house boats have been left stranded on a vast stretch of the lake bed, now a lush grassland.
The drought, which has seen no rainfall for two months, has struck the central Chinese provinces that are known as the country's "home of rice and fish".
Almost half of all the country's rice fields have been affected and four million people do not have access to drinking water.
At Honghu Lake, in Hubei province, fish farmers have seen 80 per cent of their stocks die. "More than 20,000 acres of fish farms have been severely damaged," said Zou Haibin, the local Communist party secretary in Dianhe, to Xinhua.
"I was born in 1967 and have never seen anything like this," added Li Liangjun, a fish farmer in Dianhe. "Even my father has never seen anything like it. It has not rained for nearly three months".
The drought has pushed up vegetable prices in major cities by as much as 30 per cent, and the government has warned that if it continues it may have an effect on this year's rice harvest.
However, the Chinese weather bureau has warned there is no rain in sight and that it expects the drought to continue until early June.










Yang, who burst onto the scene in 1992 when he set the first of his 17 Guinness world records, is taking his successful Gazillion Bubble Show to Shanghai in July.
Whilst blowing away the press with a short promotional performance, Yang promised to mark his first show in China with an attempt to match one of his records 每 fitting 150 people inside a single bubble.
The skilled performer 每 who claims to have invented his own secret seven-ingredient recipe for bubble formula 每 is no stranger to the cameras, he once popped up on the Oprah Winfrey Show where he managed to fit 100 people inside a soapy cylinder in 2008.
