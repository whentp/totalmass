
National day is just around the corner. I believe most of us are looking forward to this day coming, cause we can have a long time to rest. In the 7 days, you can do whatever you like. For me, i have half and five days to break. In this special day, i suddenly feel kind of sentimental, which makes me miss my university classmates. So when i turned on my computer, i just wanted to get some information about them. It's lucky for me to come across two roommates. We were very happy and excited to hear our voices. We haven't seen each other since we graduated for two years. Now we are living in different places. One of them will get married in this month, because the wedding is not going to be hold in this holiday, i can't attend it. when i heard that she will marry, that's so sweet. I can't help thinking of the wedding that we had a disscusion in our dorm. We agreed to attend the wedding of everyone. However, it seems that things are not happening as we expected. We were talking for a long time this tonight, and it's a bit disappointed that the rest of them couldn't join in us. I am really enjoying this kind of feeling that we are talking everyday life with each other and need to know our life. It is not what we are talk but how to share our daily life with each other that counts. Since we have slim chance to meet each other, why not start such this kind of conversation by mirophone. Hearing the familiar voices is enough!








It is one fo those days that you don't want to get up. You just want to stay in bed and stare at the ceiling for a long time. Then you start to lose feeling in your body, becoming absolutely numb because of lack of movement. That was how i felt these days. This holiday I didn't plan to go out, I were at home with nothing to do. I couldn't manage my time properly, owing to my laziness. Getting up late and going to bed late were my recent routine way. Just like at the noon, i was in sofa with remote controller in hand, staring at the screen. Even though i thougth these programmes were boring, i did not turn off it. I really could not enjoy them and my mind was blank. There seemed to be another voice saying to me that you are wasting your time and do something useful. Finally, i got out of my sofa and went to my study, picked up my book. I felt sleepy as soon as I finished a few pages. Because I didn't force my eyes open and could not keep my attention, I took a short nap. During these days i really missed that i was in strength and condition.
To be flank, I was not good at controlling my spare time, except surfing the internet I couldn't find another  thing interesting. After wasting time and energy, i woould feel a bit guity. So I just hope I will try improving and enrich my life soon. This is what I want.








I have just no idea what's wrong with me. I have been taking good care of myself, for I am not in a good condition. When i was a little girl, i used to catch a cold which often borther me. I hate being ill. Even though the other think this is not a big problem. However, once i was ill, i had to take medicine as the doctor told me. When the pills were used up, i found my health could not turn out to be well, so i was suffering the illness which made me not breathe freely and i have got this tickle in my throast. I don't know why i was apt to get a cold. Though i'm always noticing the temperature every day. When my colleagues got a cold, they just needed to take several pills and the condition would be well quickly. For me,  this is no luck. Oh, my god, i just hope i can get rid of the cold as quickly as possible.









Several days ago, i got an apartment to live in with another three girls. It's not easy to get this apartment which is near our work place.  we quickly got in contact with our dean and the householder as soon as we got this piece of news. That apartment which is nice is on the sixth floor of a building. Because there is much furniture in it, which is convenient for us to live in. After cleaning up the whole house, we put our own things in it. When i sat in the sofa, It seemed that i could find that feeling when we were at the dorm of university. That feeling made me cosy. Anyway i am looking forward to the future life in this apartment.










In my life, I'm not a considerate girl and often forget something, which is known by my friends and colleagues. So there are some embarrasing scenes and jokes caused by myself. Especially after I graduating from university, I can not remember others' name and mix their names. For example, several of colleagues, their family name is Chen. However, when I come across the other colleagues whose family name is not Chen, I often make  mistakes by calling them Chen. Sometimes, they make a joke of me and say whether you may find a boyfriend whose surname is Chen. Because i know my weakness well, I don't dare to call their names when i am not sure of it.
 
However, until today i've found that i have been making a mistakes for several months. There is a seventy-year-old man who has retired. Several months ago, because of a trip, I knew this energetic man. I thought his surname is Wang. So after that trip, when I often meet with him on the way to work, I smile to and greet him: good moring , mr wang. And he just smiles to me. There is a chance today that i sat near to him. After calling him mr wang, long tim no see, how's it going? He doesn't answer and writes his surname Li on my book, at this moment, i'm really embarrassed at my mistakes. Oh, I can't believe that I have made such the same mistake and i really can't stand myself.
 
As a result, " It is abnormal for me to remember some people's names." say my colleagues. For me, it seems a nightmare for me making such stupid mistakes. It is antonsihing to know that some big persons can remember the names of all the people whom they meet and know in their life and can't forget them for ever.
If you gals know how to remember the names of people, can you share your ways with me?











Now this is not the first time that i've seen the other several girls laugh at Lily. Lily and the other five girls graduated from university this year and they become my colleagues. Lily is a good and honest girl, because of her honesty, she becomes the one the other girls make fun of. Her words, clothes and the way of doing often have them make fun of her. But most of the time i don't see her defy their laughing. They know her weakness, so their common topic is about talking about Lily, no matter where they are. Sometimes I can't accept it and I can find the past time when i was like Lily. Because i am often the one who the other colleagues play tricks on. I've thought of that reason why someone is the one made fun of and the other are the people who like to laugh at one. As I know, when the other want to make fun of you, if you accept it and don't do about that. With the days going on, you will be the one played tricks on. At the same time, that may make a relaxing atmosphere for others but will affect your mood and hurt your feeling.
 
So it's very important to learn to how to cope with that situation after you enter the place where you work. You have the right to say no to their words and action. I just hope Lily will find a way to get out! Good luck to you!















 Yesterday I dreamed a dream. Until now I have remembered what the dream is. In the dream, I am a senior student and is going to take the college entrance exam. I was late for near half hour as soon as i got to a school to take part in this importance exam. After talking with a teacher, I was allowed to get into the school. What surprised me most is that I really don't know which classroom I should go. I was like a idoit walking through the campus to find where I should go. Unfortunately, I couldn't find it and then I woke up. When I opened my eyes, I just realised this was a dream. Cause when I was at university, a psychology teacher said:" In fact, every dream you do is meaningful for you. And it reflects what you want and your thought is. So I try to explain this dream by myself. It means that I want to change the present condition, but I don't prepare well for it. Am I right?














Today is my birthday. But birthday for me is not special just like a common day. I just have a big meal with with my family. There was a big surprise for me. I've never thought my students will know that and send a lovely cake for me. Besides, I received a small notebook where some of them wrote some words to me. Which make me feel excited and happy. Especially when I heard them sing birthday song for me, I were feeling i was the happiest teacher in the world. I really appreciate it. Because of their action and words, I can live a really happy life as a teacher. Sometimes, when I recall something unhappy happened and someone's bad behavior and weaks that i can't stand, I suppose that this sort of work is hard for me and even though I thought if I was suitable for this position or considering changing my job. Until now, I've found that doesn't really matter. What I should do is to try to do my best to affect some and make them realise what to face and how to make use of their time and talent.
 
At the same time, I got some advice from kids. As they said, When you are smiling to us, you look more attractive. Yeap, what I need to do is to smile a lot in class. I'm not serous but seldom smile. I really expect I can often smile but it's not easy for me to smile naturally in class. Anyway, don't worry, i'm trying to do it.
Much appreciated, kids!















It seems that some of people would like to choose this month to get marry. Why would I think so? I was told that two girls of my old friend will marry in the following days. I'm really happy for them and they have find the right persons. It's a little pity that I could not attend their wedding with my parents. And the next month, another best friend, huihui will get marry too. Besides, during the National Day, sky, my college sweetheart married to her Mr Right. Oh, my God, this year is really important for these girls. Anyway, hoping their love life can be lasting for good.
Gals, Best wishes to you!
















Riding a bicycle is a good way to make you fit. However, I'm not good at it. So I haven't tried to ride it until I got a bicycle as a birthday present. I'm not really the one who can know cope with it quickly. Anyway, I'm really happy for that, though I need to overcome my fear that i'm afraid of riding on a busy road. At first, I dare not go out to the road where there are many cars, motors and bicycles. Especially I worry a lot for fear I may hurt someone or be hurt when I come to a cross-road. At this moment, I just say to myself," only if I get rid of my worry, I can overcome the fear." So just do it. After riding on the road with some people, it seems not to be terrible as I think of. What i have to do is to concentrate on the situation of the road. That feeling is wonderful when you ride a bicycle with the wind. However, the trouble will always trouble the green. I want to enter the narrow gate as soon as I find there is no motors and cars, but when I reach the mid of the gate, suddenly, there is a motor rushing to me, which make me feel horrible. Because I don't know how the thing happens and i stop. I just feel i can not control my balance so that I fall down to the pillar of the gate. My face was hurt. Feeling fortunate, the pain is not serious. Maybe i am lack of the skill of protecting myself. From then on, I am feeling nervous, when cycle with the some cars, motors, people on the road. I even have no idea if I can keep on it.















It's getting more and more cold. Even though today is sunny. However, I can't feel the warm from the sunshine. In order to examine my body, I had to get up at 7 o'clock this morning. When i got to the bus stop, i found one of my colleagues, YY was waiting for me. I was really sorry to have her waiting. A short time later, we arrived at the hospital. There was a few people waiting for examining body, we felt so happy that this experienc was different from that of last year. As you know, it's so quickly that we just spent one hour on that. Just hoping everything is ok. Especially the results of the blood will be known soon. Every time some of people examined are something wrong. So a few people are afraid of examining their bodies. Anyway, for me, examining bodies once a year is not bad.










When we look at the date on the calendar, we know the Christmas Day is around the corner. Owing to the special day, some of us always would like to something special to celebrate it. If we just spend the day just like the ordinary day, sounds very pity for us, right? I don't know when most of Chinese people are crazy about the Chrismas Day, especially among young men. What's more, we fall into a habit of celebrating it by sending the apples to ones who we care very much on the Christmas Even. Here apples mean the best wishes. This is not supersition. It is just a way to send our love to others.
 
On such a special day, how to spend it well sounds a difficult question for us. Cause everyone hopes they can be totally relaxed after the work. Once the work is over this day, we can avoid talking about how to spend with friends. As i thought, Joy called me up in a long distant the moment she saw me. I just awaited her, smiling to her. She wears a new coat in red, which quite stand out. The color really fit for her and make others feel warm. When she come up to me, she asked if you had thought where to go or what to do the next day. I answered with a smile, " do you have a good idea? and you are supposed to be with your BF, right?". She responded, " oh, he can't come back, so i'm alone as well." After talking about some triflling matters, we still didn't make a decision about that. Maybe we should wait the next day, when everything will be done tomorrow. Perhaps we will come up with a good idea. Hoping all of us have a sweet night.










How time flies! This year will be over and the new year is around the corner. As usual, it's time for us to look back the gone days and make new year's resolution. I am really bad at my memory. Cause I have no idea the resolution for 2010. It doesn't matter to me whether i can think of it or not. But the one thing that I found this website by chance last year is very important for me. Owing to it, I find there are some people insisting on writing down their thoughts, no matter who they are, students or the ones who have been away school for years. They like to express what they want to say in English. They encourage me to do something like that. Even though i don't set down something here every day, sometimes i try my best to write something. I rarely like to talk with others on the internet, but i find sometimes someone who is worthing talking, which makes me happy and excited. Anyway, the next year, i hope i can have more blogs here.













As we all kwon, we can't stop time flying. We have no power to control the past or the future. What we can control is how to spend today, right? 2011 is coming on, that is to say, a new year is approaching. However, I'm afraid that the time flies so quickly in front of my eyes. With the days going on, I am not willing to face the new year. I don't know why I have the strong feeling about that, even though i begin to recall my feeling when I say goodbye to 2008 and hi to 2009, but my mind is blank. Because I have a poor memory, and i haven't written some thoughts about that.  And I often asked to myself," why am I not happy with the new year coming?". To be frank,  it's because I dread getting older or i'm not satisfied with the 2010. As for this topic, i've asked one of my colleagues, ting who is one year younger than me. She has the same way with me about the new year coming. Maybe there exists another question that we are single. So there is no doubt that we hope we will find Mr. Right in the coming year.
 
At the end of the 2010, I think it necessary to think of this year. It seems that i haven't done anything except travelling some places. I was impressed with the trip to Hua Mount. Climbing from the foot to the top of the mountain. Although the process is really hard and I even thought of giving up on the half way, in the end, I made it by myself. Standing on the top of the mountain, I felt so excited and happy that I couldn't feel tired at all. This was the firt time that I had climbed such a high mountain. At that time, my mind pictured the scene that I and the other three girls had been climbing the Tai Mount several years ago, with so many stars in the black sky. That happiness can't be described by words. Anyway, traveling can make me excited and energetic. It's an important part of my life.















This is the last day of 2010. Almost people want to send their best wishes and hope to accept regards from others, including me. 2011 is approaching. Hoping my family and friends who care and love me will be happy and well. Mam. Especially daddy, I hope he will be lucky when he and others play mahjong together. Cause he is bad at that.
 
Unfortunately, it is a way of killing time when he is on holiday. Even if I told him to go fishing or do something else, he is accustomed to that and doesn't want to change. So just wish him and mom a good luck and a healthy body.
 For my brother, his dream is to be a civil servant and i hope he will realise his dream. In order to reach this goal, he spares no efforts to read some related information. Because he wants to be a good offical who can serve the people with his heart and mind. I admire him all the time, not because he is my brother, but because he has such an ambitious will. So I really hope the new year is a lucky year for him.
 
The new year is a key year for sunny, my aunt's daughter who will graduate from the junior high school. Getting into a key senior high school will be her new year wish. In short, go for it, my lovely sister.
 
At this moment, I just refused to accept a chance to go out with a boy. In fact, i don't want to do that. I really feel like hanging out with some guys during several days off . However, this guy is not my cup of tea. I would rather enjoy the loneliness alone at home than go out with them.  So it's not difficult to imagine how I will spend this holiday. That sounds kind of boring, uhu!










I got up late this morning, because this is the last day to relax. During the three-day holiday, I stayed at home with noting to do, felt kind of bored, but it's really relaxing for me. Time always flies, no matter what something happens, which makes me want to make good use of it. So i will devote myself to work and study as soon as the holiday passes. After short of rest, I can get more energentic and motive to do something i'm supposed to do.
 
In the new year, we always expect we can perform better than before, right?  Moreover, i'm the one who likes to have a lot of dreams. I hope they will come true. No matter what kind of dream come true, I really cheer up myself. From that moment on, I really feel life is so beautiful, do you agree ?











After the work,I went to go shopping. I intended to buy some things but I never thought that I would buy a new pair of shoes. Indeed, I really bought the pair. Why? This prices of shoes went down greatly. So the price drew my attention. No sooner had I got into the shop than the shopkeeper began to encourage me to try them out. One of pair was nice and the size fit me well. Considering its price, size and comfort, I made a decision to buy it. I just wanted to wear the new shoes, don't want to change my shoes again. Then i had to admit myself making a mistake without looking over the shoes carefully. When I came up to my home, I felt it's less comfortable to wear them than before. It rubbed my skin. After taking off it, I found some part was not designed well. From that moment, I really regretted buying it. Owing to wearing them back, it's impossible to change them. Perhaps God is laughing at me, " you deserve that." From this thing, I learned that i would be like an idiot when I went inot a shop. According to my experience, I should buy something i need and control the impulse to buy other things without thinking. The most important point is not the price but the quality. In order to punish myself, I made up my to mind not to buy any clothes and sweet food in this month.










It's a nice day. After work, I as well as other colleagues decided to go out for a walk. As we walked, we talked. When we came up to the commerical street, Joy, she said," hey, gals, let's go to one of shop, where i'v found a nice dress, I think. I hope you can give me your advice." Then we followed joy to that shop. Entering the shop, the shopkeeper were active in greeting us. Joy began to try out the dress which she had tried out. It seemed that we were not pleased with it. So she was asked to wear another two dressed. As for them, we had different opinions about that.
 
Joy just said, " i need your suggestions, but what you say make me confused. Cause i don't know which one to choose."
I answered," you are not short of clothes, you 'd better buy the dress you like very much, maybe our ideas are not important."
 
After trying them out, she didn't make her up mind to take it. Leaving that shop, we visited other shops. It was a pity that she didn't choose any dress at last.
 
Then as we planned, we went to supermarket, where i had not visited it for a long time. In order to buy some food, I walked into it with them. In a few minutes, in order not to buy more things, I quickly got several things I needed, and came to the cash desk to pay for them. Having paid for them, I took them into my bag. At this moment, a lady who I know called me. I just said hi to her and went out of the market and waited for the other. Several minutes later, they came out of it with a lot of things in their bags.
 
I came to home, so i could't go with them to other shops. When I came back by bus, i found one of thing was lost. I tried my best to recall what had happened. The only reason was that I forgot it after talking to that lady. Oh damn it! I really couldnl't stand my carelessness in my daily life. It seems that that kind of thing often happens to me. I always do what I can to get rid of my carelessness. It's not easy for me. I even don't know when i can get away from that. 

















I definitly admited that you really got a better result than me. But you have no right to doubt the other's effort. Even though you had no right to say your effort is much bigger than the other. When you said that, I was really angry with you. You just cared about yourself and didn't care about my feeling. It's very common that we have the different opinions about the one thing. When you could't persuade me, please don't put your views to measure me. As we know, when the one is not only your friend but also your opponent, it's really hard to cope with that, right? However, I'm not good at arguing with others and i have no strong desire to excel others in work and words. So i'm just a kind one in their eyes. This kind of character often makes me in a bad mood, especially in the workplace. And now I 've doubted myself if I could survive in such kind of intense environment and keep on working happily for ever. Maybe you think i'm a coward facing compete with others. I'm not afraid of competing with others at all, but of the bad relationship between you and me.














After coming home from uncle's, I haven't read a book for several days. It's not because i haven't time, but because I haven't any desire to read it. I had a strong feeling to read it this afternoon while staying at uncle's home. I was very happy for myself. Then i analysed why I had that feeling. I found that they were playing cards which i wasn't really interested in. So I needed to find something to do to kill the time. Reading is what I want. During the Spring Festival, there is no doubt that playing cards is playing an important role in making communicating with each other. In our daily life, I really dislike the way to spend our spare time. While this is a special time, i can accept this way to enhance the relationsip between we and our relatives. Sometimes I wonder how we chinese people are smart and clever. It is they that invented the mahjong. I mean this is the way of playing mahjong with our relatives and friends to entertain ourselves. 
 
Now come back to the former topic, I must finish the book as i planned. In the following days I'll continue to read it or write down something. Just do what i want and need.














Yesterday we went to my grandma's to send new year to her, my uncles and cousins. Now today, it's our turns to treat them. This morning we didn't get up so early, because mom had prepared in advance some yesterday evening. After having breakfast with my family, mom was busy in preparing the lunch for our guests. And I became an assistant for her to clean vegetables and make some garden sauces. When guests came to my home, my duty is to welcome them by making fireworks and make tea and let them taste some snacks for them. Then i started to lay the table and some necessity for the lunch. When it's 11 o'clock, mom and i began to cook food in the kitchen. I was an assistant, so mom's main task was to cook the delicious food. Once the dish was finished, my job was to take it to the table. Drinking and eating lasted for 45 mins or so. Mom had prepared some dishes, so some dishes hadn't chance to be cooked.For they were very full.
 
Mom was very tired to cook so many dishes for us. After dinner, I was supposed to clean all the things in kitchen. Even though I felt a bit tired, I was very happy that i really helped her to do something to let her have a good rest. Having cleaned the dishes and some cookers, I continued to clean up the table and the floor. Doing this and that took a long time for me. It's time for me to have a break. I just sat near to my nanny, drinking and watching. After changing several channels, I came across a show that I prefer very much and enjoyed it.While I looked back to the whole day, I found the time flies quickly. A day passed like wind. In the rest time of this day, I should spend time on reading my book as I said yesterday.

















This was the second time that we had met. We sat together, talking and drinking. It's hard to image that we have talked for about five hours. He is a talktive boy. So I just was a listener for most of the time. From his talking, I have got some more information about him. He was very independent and paid for his fees and living expenses when he was in university. In order to reduce his parents' burden, he was working as a tutor for 5 students at the same time. And now He is a teacher of math in a middle school. He is crazy about talking his colleagues and work life in Zhongshan. Sometimes I yawned even though we drank tea as we talked. Having noticed my look, he asked why I looked unhappy. I just didn't know how to answer him. And you know, when you are not happy, it's not difficult to tell others you are happy. Because your facial expression tell them your mood. After getting home, they asked me what's your feeling on him. My answer--even if  we have something in common, but I was just like talking with a friend, a talktive person. I don't know if it's necessary to further know about him.














It is rainy today. Even though it's at the end of Februray, it's still a bit cold. When i walk out of the house, sometimes a gust of wind is blowing, which make me put on my gloves. After receiving a call, i know i have to go out for a dinner that i can not refuse. Then I choose to walking in the rain with an umbrella in my hand to get to that restaurant. On arriving there, I meet with one of my colleagues and go to a booked room with him. There are several persons sitting and talking there. I just say hello to them, waiting for the rest of people. After a short time, everyone is there and the dishes are put on the table. There is no doubt that dinking is the most important for them during eating at table. In their view, if there is no spirits and beer, they can not enjoy themselves. As for me, i hate receiving this kind of rule that you should toast to some people and they will toast to you one by one. Why should we do that? I even don't know the meaning of that. So the most moment we just pretend to be those who do that with a smile on our face. Every time i attend this kind of feast, I seldom enjoy these dishes. While I am walking out of the restaurant, I still feel I am not full at all. Maybe I'm not the one who can be a sociable person during the dinner. It's really hard for me to enjoy this kind of meal. Eating is a enjoyable thing for me, but there I must pretend to do what i don't want to do.
















Just now i finished watching the King's Speech. Having heard this movie receive a big Oscar Award, i decided to watch it. This king is Elizabeth Queen's father who can speak like the normal persons, for he stammers. So he is afraid of speaking in public. However, he has to be a king of Uk since his brother gives up the right of king in order to marry a woman. Speaking in front of his people is his duty. While he was standing before the mircophone, he began to stammer and even didn't know how to open his mouth. It's a lucky thing for him that he has a great wife who finds a good teacher to cure the king's stammer. After being trainned for a long time, the king managed to make a powerful speech for his people to encourage the people to fight against Hitler.
 
Some scenes that interest me are that the king tries his best to train himself to overcome his stammer. Besides, his success is related to his wife who is always with him. At last, i really want to say the actor who plays the part of the king in this movie. In order to play this part well, he really spares no effort to immate the persons who stammer and speak some sentence structures of that time. When you notice the king speak, you will find the actor is not playing this part he is the king who can't speak fluently. The movie is really worth watching.

It's nice today. The rain said goodbye to us yesterday. When I woke up this morning, I can sense the sunshine makes me warm and comfortable even though the curtain stop most of the sunshines. After a big breakfast, I began to change my sheets. It's a good day for me to wash them and dry them in the sun. So I almost spend the whole morning washing sheets and clothes and cleaning the house. It's kind of tired but I hung them on the line, which make me relax and happy. The heat of the sun will dry them and I can even sense the smell of the sun on them.
 
This afternoon I planned to a hospital and a bank. The hospital is a place I don't want to go most. However, I can't avoid it. Finally, I went there. The whole process didn't cost not more than twenty minutes. The doctor seemed very busy even though there was few patient. His phone rang several times while talking to me. In fact, every time I went to hosiptal and talked with a doctor, I could get some information I should know. Besides, I found they are not reliable for me, even if they are experts in this field. Most of doctors i met didn't make a good impression on me. They were always busy and could not explain something or detail clearly. Most of time you'll find you haven't understand what he said, he told you to pay money for this medicine according to this prescription. While I was very unlucky, a kind of medicine was sold out. So I had to another medicine shop the doctor told me. I told a girl the name of this medicine, the girl was sorry to tell me that you would come here a few days later. I was disappointed to leave there and went to a bank where i opened my bank account and web bank successfully. After coming back home, i tried my best to enter my web bank sever times. In the end, I didn't recall it yet. That I forgot the user name of web bank made me mad. Oh, it's really horrible afternoon.











I told myself that I must finish my paper in this month. While the time is going, i haven't write down a single word yet. I feel a bit of ashame of myself and guilty. After I turned on my company, I could not concentrate on setting down something about the paper. Not until I turned off my computer did I relise my main task. After completing this entry, I have to write the outline first. From now on I will put my enery and time in this paper I have told several colleagues around me before. So I can't eat my words in front of them and the important thing comes fiist. Fighting, fighting fighting!











It's really pleased to receive a call from a classmate of senior high. Talking about something about herself and me, then she said that you are still single now and how about my brother and do you remember him? Oh, My Dear, I can't believe my ear. It's really weird, right? If your friend want to introduce his brother to you, and she wants you to be a girlfriend of his brother. What do you think of this? So i just shouted to her, " you must be joking, right?"  " It's quite possible. if you can often chat.", she answered me. Then she stopped to tell me about some information about his brother. I just listened and couldn't accept this kind of thing. This talk lasted for near one hour. I had to admit that you are really a good sister and i had never met a sister like you who are so nice to your brother. Before ending a conversation, she said she would come to see in a short time.
 
I had thought it would be over about that. I realised she is serious until I got a message from her today. " would you tell me how to find you and where to meet you. I know you are free today, right?" Having got the messaage she needed, she met with me very soon. At the beginning of our talk, we talked about most of things about her marriage and some other things. Suddenly, she took out some photos and a piece of paper on which his brother's experience is written from her handbag and gave them to me. " Oh, my god, You can't be serious." I shouted in surprise. She said that you just had a try and didn't feel embarrassed and she would be all right if you couldn't find something in common. Then as a sister, she started to talk about her brother in detail. Once she paused, I would try to ask something about her life and husband and so on. when I saw her off, she did not forget to remind me of his brother and hoped we could chat online ect.
Oh, I can't imagine this kind of thing happened to me.











I 'm sick of myself, because I left my paper in my office. When I got home, I found that there is no paper in my handbag. One of my bad habits is often that I can't find something when I need it. So my colleagues know I'm really a careless person. Sometimes the bad habit is awful for me and makes me waste of a lot of time and cause much trouble I 've never exptected. So I often tell myself that I should be more careful and put something in the exact place it belongs to. After spending a few minutes put everything in order, I 'm not even aware that I 'll make everything in a mess soon. You can imagine that every drawer is in out of order. In order to be a careful person, I try my best to think about something before I do it. We know the bad habit is not easy to get rid in a short time, which means I need my will and determination to face and overcome it. After writing down things about it, I really hope I can give up my bad habits little by little.











Recently I found some of friends have been full now, because they haven't update their journals for ages. One of them is a girl whose writing style is really special and makes you feel relax and happy, just like that she is your close friend and share her daily life with you. Besides, you can enjoy music she picks out as you are reading her words. Every journal has a topic to talk about for us. She is the one what she wants and needs and her attitude towards life and study can encourage us to face our difficulties in our life. Sometimes her words often make me moved, since her words remind me of my dreams and goals and not stop where I am.
 
Another is huckabee who also hasn't bee there for a while. Although I 'm looking forward to reading his new journals, he is busy with his work. I form a habit of reading their words. After finding there is no new ones, i'm really kind of  disappointed. Anyway, I really miss them, and hope everything will be ok to them.









After my dad knew my several roommates, he started to want to know something about them. For example, do they each have boyfriend? How about their ages? somehting like that! When i told him they are like me single, my dad said that is why they are living together. Why havent' they find boyfriends, especially in your ages? What's more, you havent' made such a huge achievement, right? Althoug my dad's word kind of struck me, yet I lived with it because I know he is really worried about my situation.
 
I 've noticed that my dad' ve began to watch the program about blind date because of his daughter. He always watch some serious news and programs on TV, which is his favorite. I 'm really so sorry for that, for i make them upset me. I've ever tried to communicate with others, but I can't walk into their hearts, neither do they. Even if I told dad that I'll find the right one. Anyway, at first I should keep up fighting and improving myself in my work. That really matters, too. At last , I want to share this sentence I just find from a friend's journal with you: Life's short, don't make it shorter.
