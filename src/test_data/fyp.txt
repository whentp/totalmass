This study examined how thinking styles, learning approaches, value attachment, and family background of a student relate to his or her academic achievement. Methods: One hundred and ninety-seven Hong Kong junior secondary school students participated in the study. Sternberg¡¯s Thinking Style Inventory (TSI), Biggs¡¯ Learning Process Questionnaires (LQP), and Rudowicz¡¯s questionnaire were used respectively to evaluate thinking styles, learning approaches, and value attachment adopted by students. Results: Principal component analysis revealed a five-factor structure for the TSI and a two-factor structure for the LPQ. Results indicated that legislative thinking style was positively related to academic achievement. It was also found that deep and achieving learning approaches were correlated with higher academic results. The ¡°versatile learners¡± image of Hong Kong students using different learning approaches in order to get higher academic results was confirmed. Students¡¯ background was found to be an important factor influencing their thinking styles and learning approaches and hence their academic results. Attachment to Chinese values was shown to be positively correlated with academic achievement. Discussion: The results suggest that teachers should design different learning activities to accommodate different needs of students to enhance learning motivation and effectiveness.










This study explored the relationship between students¡¯ academic achievement, self-concept, and test anxiety. Both within and between schools comparisons were made to evaluate the effect of the long and short term academic achievement on self-concept and test anxiety. In addition, the effect of gender on self-concept and test anxiety was also examined. Methods: Three hundred and twenty-three Hong Kong secondary school Form 1 students, with 214 from a higher band school and 109 from a lower band school, participated in the study. They completed the Chinese Adolescent Self-Esteem Scale (CSSES) and the Test Anxiety Inventory (TAI). Results: The findings supported the Big Fish Little Pond (BFLP) effect on the ability within, but not between schools. The BFLP effect was not only found on students¡¯ academic self-concept sub-scales, but also on some of their non-academic self-concept sub-scales. Moreover, high band students had more emotional disturbances during examinations, whereas low achievers had greater worries about academic failure. Gender effect was found on self-concept and test anxiety. A weak negative correlation was found between self-concept and test anxiety. Discussion: The results demonstrate the importance of within school comparisons on students¡¯ self-concept. Categorizing students into different band schools may generate a labeling effect on students¡¯ self-concept, which may in turn affect their academic achievement.












 This study examined the effects of cultural orientation (individualism vs. collectivism) and positive performance feedback type (individual vs. group) on achievement motivation and attributional beliefs (internal vs. external). Methods: The participants were eighty 10-year-olds to 12-year-olds Hong Kong Chinese children. They completed a questionnaire that assesses their cultural orientation, attributional beliefs, and perceived causes of achievement. Then, they were assigned into 4 groups with different combinations of positive performance feedback type. Half-way through a perceptual task, participants received positive performance feedback according to their experimental condition. After the perceptual task, participants completed a questionnaire regarding their attributional belief. Children¡¯s achievement motivation was measured by the choice of task and the accuracy of work throughout the perceptual task. Results: The results revealed that both individual and group positive performance feedback, compared to no feedback, increased achievement motivation. Also, it was found that positive performance feedback was associated with internal attribution (i.e., attributing success or failure to effort and ability). Contrary to the expectation, group feedback did not enhance collectivists¡¯ achievement motivation. The individual feedback was found to be the most effective in enhancing achievement motivation for both individualists and collectivists. In addition, collectivists were found to have higher achievement motivation than individualists, and they attributed more success or failure to internal causes. Discussion: The findings suggest that the nature and the availability of feedback can directly influence or enhance Hong Kong Chinese children¡¯s achievement motivation.










This study tried to develop a treatment group based on the cognitive behavioral approach, to help schizophrenic patients to cope with their psychiatric symptoms. The effectiveness of the treatment group in reducing psychotic symptoms and the functional improvement resulted among schizophrenic patients were assessed. Methods: A total of 50 psychiatric in-patients who were diagnosed to be suffering from schizophrenia with active positive psychotic symptoms for more than one year (i.e., treatment resistant) were recruited from Kwai Chung Hospital. The experimental group received cognitive behavioral therapy group, whereas the control group received a series of educational groups. A pretest and two posttests (immediately after the treatment and at one-month follow-up) were conducted to assess patients¡¯ schizophrenic symptoms and functional abilities. Two trained occupational therapists who were blinded to the hypothesis rated the participants in both conditions. Results: Both measurement of symptom areas and functional abilities had a moderate to high internal consistency and inter-rater reliability. Patients who stayed longer in the hospital tend to have poorer self-care, more disturbing behavior, and lower social and general function. Social, affect, and thought process symptom categories were strongly negatively correlated with patients¡¯ self-care, social contact, and communication skills. No significant difference was found between the experimental and control group in their functional abilities after the treatments. Significant difference was found between the two groups in the symptom hallucinations when tested immediately after the treatments, but not on the one-month follow-up test. Discussion: The fading of the improvement in the present study may be due to the lack of practice and environmental constraint. After the treatment phase, participants will have to resume to their previous daily routines in the hospital, which are not favorable to the practice of the cognitive behavioral coping method.











The role of memory, reasoning, and perceptual speed in learning of Chajei were studied among people with lower intelligence (i.e., mentally retarded) and those with normal intelligence. Methods: Eighty-two participants completed questionnaires that assess participants¡¯ reasoning, perceptual speed, speed of long-term memory retrieval, speed of short-term memory scanning, and decision speed. They were also given a typing test to assess their accuracy and typing speed. Results: Results showed that working memory (both retrieval speed and accuracy), reasoning, and perceptual speed were significantly poorer in people with lower intelligence. However, for these individuals, only reasoning was correlated with their proficiency in using Chajei. On the other hand, only the speed of long-term memory access was correlated with proficiency in using Chajei for people with normal intelligence. Discussion: The reasoning threshold hypothesis is proposed, which suggest that only when one¡¯s reasoning above a certain threshold can one be able to learn Chajei. But when one¡¯s reasoning is above the threshold, the speed of long-term memory access becomes critical to the performance in using Chajei. As reasoning is a relatively stable cognitive component, Chajei may be too difficult for people with mental handicaps. Therefore, other ¡°easier¡± Chinese Character Input Method may be taught to them.









The present study aimed to (i) identify personality dimensions that are salient to the Hong Kong Chinese context on the basis of a taxonomy developed by Lai, Luk, and Wan (2002) using the approach of Implicit Personality Theory (IPT), and (2) to examine the congruence between the structure of the identified indigenous dimensions and that of the well established Big Five Personality Factors. Methods: A total of 212 participants were requested to rate each trait on a 9-point scale according to how accurate each trait describes themselves (self rating). They were also asked to nominate a peer to complete the same questionnaire. The selected peers were asked to rate each trait according to their knowledge of the participant on how accurate each trait describes him or her (peer rating). Results: Results indicated that 3 emic personality factors were salient to the Hong Kong Chinese, which exhibited a clear social and relationship orientation. Although substantial overlap was observed between these emic factors and the five-factor solutions as derived from the Western Big Five markers, one-to-one correspondence between the two sets of factors was not identified.









 This study examined whether the Big Five Personality Inventory, currently used in many organizations¡¯ selection batteries, is as capable of predicting job performance of Customer Service Representatives (CSR) in offshore call centers as it is of other people-oriented occupations. Methods: Survey questionnaires were distributed by two administrative assistants to CSRs with at least one year of tenure as performance appraisal was conducted on an annual basis. A total of 101 questionnaires were completed. The survey assessed their personality by the Big Five Personality Inventory, their job performance by subjective measurements (i.e., evaluations by their team leaders and supervisors), and their job performance by objective measurements (i.e., the average number of calls handled per hour, the number of compliments, and the number of complaints received). Results: Consistent with the hypothesis, Extraversion, Conscientious, and Openness to Experience were associated with job performance judged by supervisors. Agreeableness and Neuroticism did not yield any statistical significant effect on any of the performance dimensions. None of the Big Five personality dimensions yielded any correlations with the objective measures of job performance. Discussion: This analysis shed light on the use of personality measures for personnel decisions in large organizations, particularly with CSRs. By selecting and hiring those who possess personality characteristics that are related to quality service and employee performance, level of customer satisfaction can be enhanced.

This study examined the contributions of academic failure, causal attributions, and academic self-concept to learned hopelessness among Hong Kong secondary school students. Methods: One hundred and forty-four Hong Kong secondary school Form 2 students were categorized into four groups: high band high achievers, high band low achievers, low band high achievers, and low band low achievers. The level of learned hopelessness, academic self-concept, and causal attributions for academic events were compared among the four groups. Results: Consistent with the hopelessness theory of depression, prior academic failure and low academic self-concept were found to be the most important predictors of learned hopelessness. Regarding the causal attributions, it was found that only causal uncontrollability contributed to the development of learned hopelessness. Results also showed that both short and long term academic low achievers suffered from low academic self-concept and high level of learned hopelessness, while both short and long term high academic achievers benefited from high academic self-concept and low level of learned hopelessness. Discussion: These findings may help teachers and parents identify the cognitive precursors that contribute to the development of learned hopelessness among Hong Kong secondary school students, and to appreciate the importance of experiencing academic success.









 This study explored the applicability of Bartholomew and Horowitz¡¯s (1991) four-category model on Chinese young adults in Hong Kong. In particular, it investigated the effects of four adult attachment prototypes (i.e., secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and fearful) on self-esteem, peer relationship, and family relationship. Methods: One hundred and ninety-two young adults with median age of 28 completed the self-reported Attachment Style Questionnaire, the Chinese version of Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Index of Peer Relation, and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales. Results: Findings indicated that subjects with secure and dismissing attachment style, both having a positive regard of self, had higher self-esteem than the other two groups that have a negative regard of self. The secure group had the lowest magnitude of peer problem but contrary to the hypothesis, the preoccupied group had the highest magnitude of peer problem. The impact of attachment style on perception of family closeness was not obvious. Family relationship among Chinese seemed to be culturally unique. Discussion: The results suggest that the four attachment prototypes can be identified in Chinese young adults and one¡¯s social functioning is much influenced by the attachment style one belongs to. However, as the Chinese may have some characteristics unique in their culture, a Chinese adult attachment inventory should be developed for further study of adult attachment among Chinese society.











The present study compared the self-esteem of Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme (CSSA Scheme) elder recipients with that of eligible but non-CSSA elder recipients. Respondents¡¯ perception and importance of others¡¯ (i.e., family members and mass media) view on CSSA recipients and their effects on the self-esteem of CSSA and eligible non-CSSA elder recipients were also examined. Methods: Questionnaires consisted of items that assess the perception and importance of family members¡¯ and mass media¡¯s view on CSSA and non-CSSA elder recipients, items that measure self-esteem, and items that assess the demographic information of the respondents. Among the 73 completed surveys, 49 valid cases were chosen to be analyzed. The participants chosen were 49 Chinese elderly aged 60 to 79 years, of either CSSA recipients or eligible non-CSSA recipients. Results: As expected, the CSSA elder respondents had lower self-esteem than the eligible non-CSSA elder respondents. A positive correlation was found between the others¡¯ view on CSSA recipients and the self-esteem of CSSA respondents, irrelevant to the level of importance of others¡¯ view to them. In contrast, no significant correlation was found between the others¡¯ view on CSSA recipients and the self-esteem of eligible non-CSSA respondents. However, if only non-CSSA respondents who valued highly on family members¡¯ view were considered, a significant negative correlation was found between their perception of family members¡¯ view and their self-esteem. Discussion: There are practical implications from the present study for the provision of social security for elders in Hong Kong. Merely meeting the financial needs of those in poverty is insufficient, it is also necessary to take care of their psychological needs.













This study examined the social-cognitive processes between aggressive and non-aggressive children living in 9 small group homes. Methods: Housemothers¡¯ rating of aggression, peer nomination of aggression, and the reactive- and proactive- aggression scale scores of the children were used to classify the aggressive and non-aggressive group. Eight aggressive and eight non-aggressive children, aged 9 to11, were presented with one of the six videotapes, each consisting of 13 scenarios with stimulus about peer provocation situations. To assess the variables in the five steps of social information processing, an interviewer asked the participant to imagine being in the situation and to act out what he or she would do or say in response. Results: A distinct pattern of interpreting, responding, and enacting to peer¡¯s provocation was found to distinguish between aggressive and non-aggressive children in small group homes. Consistent with the hypothesis, aggressive children were found to make more attribution bias or hostile attribute to benign intention and to show less skills to enact a chosen response. Also, aggressive children were found to be more likely to interpret the ambiguous situation as hostile, generate more responses, endorse less passive responses, and favor to choose less competent responses. However, contrary to the hypothesis, no statistical significant difference was found between the two groups in endorsing aggressive and competent response. Discussion: Since attribution or interpretation to benign ambiguous social stimuli plays a role in the essential social cognitive mechanism that determines aggressive and non-aggressive behavior, an attributional intervention may be effective in decreasing childhood aggressive behavior in small group homes. Moreover, intervention programs that are designed to enhance enactment skills may also reduce childhood aggression, as the findings showed that aggressive behaviors were deficient in enactment skills.

 In the present study, participants¡¯ postural expressions were manipulated to induce automatically elicited effect, and their underlying information-processing sequence was assessed. Based on the dual-process theories (Chaiken & Trope, 1999), it was hypothesized that the information provided would prompt deliberate processing and would lead to correction on judgments. Methods: To obtain a comparison between output of the early affective and the late cognition plus affective processing, 30 participants were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions. In the uninformed condition (n=15), participants were instructed to perform arm contractions (flexion and extension) while they were exposed to nonsense word stimuli. In the informed condition (n=15), the same instructions were made except that participants were informed of the influence of contractions on their judgments. Participants¡¯ underlying information processing sequence was assessed by recording their liking judgments on nonsense word stimuli. Results: Consistent with the hypothesis and with the findings of Cacioppo, Priester, and Berntson (1993), arm contractions led to differential evaluative judgments (p<.001). Uniformed participants preferred some stimuli to others without conscious access to the source of affect. However, the pattern held even for informed participants who were made aware of the bias. Informed participants failed to correct the liking judgments (interaction, F<1). Discussion: The affect hypothesis focuses on studying the early information-processing sequence, while appraisal theories focus on the later sequences. The two approaches should not be isolated but instead, integrating the two fields is one prospective line of research.













This study explored the relation between reported stress level, perceived control in the workplace, and usage of coping strategies of employees in a high public performance appraisal situation or high performance visibility situation. Methods: The reported stress symptoms and the visibility scores of 40 professionals in the investment industry in Hong Kong and 40 non-investment professionals were compared. Results: A positive relation was found between the reported stress level and the score on the visibility scale. Despite a higher stress level experienced by employees in high performance visibility jobs, a higher perceived control in the workplace and more usage of coping strategies were found to have a negative relation with the stress level reported. The study also revealed that the most frequently used coping strategies were those focusing on positive reaction approach, which employees seek to work at solving a problem to the best of their ability. Discussion: The results demonstrate the importance of the strategies used in organizations in the investment industry. By adopting appropriate strategies, employees¡¯ psychological and physiological health may be improved substantially.











 This study examined the effects of cultural orientation (individualism vs. collectivism) and positive performance feedback type (individual vs. group) on achievement motivation and attributional beliefs (internal vs. external). Methods: The participants were eighty 10-year-olds to 12-year-olds Hong Kong Chinese children. They completed a questionnaire that assesses their cultural orientation, attributional beliefs, and perceived causes of achievement. Then, they were assigned into 4 groups with different combinations of positive performance feedback type. Half-way through a perceptual task, participants received positive performance feedback according to their experimental condition.

Contrary to the expectation, group feedback did not enhance collectivists¡¯ achievement motivation. The individual feedback was found to be the most effective in enhancing achievement motivation for both individualists and collectivists. In addition, collectivists were found to have higher achievement motivation than individualists, and they attributed more success or failure to internal causes. Discussion: The findings suggest that the nature and the availability of feedback can directly influence or enhance Hong Kong Chinese children¡¯s achievement motivation.

This study examined the viability of major components of the Health Belief Model (HBM), body-image related benefits, and social influence in predicting exercise behaviors. In particular, it is hypothesized that: (1) HBM variables, including perceived health benefits and barriers, are predictive of exercise behaviors, (2) the inclusion of social influence will enhance the overall predictive power of the model, and (3) body-image related benefits will emerge as a reliable predictor in exercise behaviors. Methods: Two hundred and forty-seven Hong Kong Chinese participants completed the Becke Questionnaire of Habitual Physical Activity, the Health Belief Model scale, and the Reasons for Exercise Inventory. Results: Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that perceived health benefits, body-image related benefits, and perceived barriers accounted for 20.3% of the variance in exercise behaviors, even when the effects of major demographic variables were controlled for. Social influence successfully improved the predictive ability of the model by 3.1%. Body-image related benefits, perceived barriers, and social influence, but not perceived health benefits, were reliable and unique predictors of exercise behaviors. Discussion: These results lend support to the utility of the HBM and psychosocial variables (perceived barriers, body-image related benefits, and social influences) to understand and predict exercise behaviors among Hong Kong Chinese.











This study investigated the differences between males and females in their preferences on mate selection. It also examined gender differences on the reaction to issues dealing with sexual and emotional infidelity. The relationship between infidelity and jealousy was also explored. Methods: Participants were 160 students attending the Open University of Hong Kong. They completed a questionnaire regarding mate preferences and issues of infidelity. In particular, they were assessed of their demographic information, the desired age difference between themselves and their mate, the attributes they desire their mate to possess, the dilemma which would upset him/her more, how they would handle such dilemma, and their jealousy level in different situations. Results: The sex-differentiated mate selection criteria that were consistent with the doctrines of evolutionary theory were found to be most pronounced. The analysis of data revealed non-significant differences between males and females in facing infidelity. Most of the participants reacted adversely to every scenario regarding infidelity, making gender distinction somewhat irrelevant. In addition, women were found to be more jealous than did men when handling emotional fidelity. Discussion. Evolutionary psychology yields insight into the reaction to sexual and emotional infidelity, and some of the domain specific, cognitive mechanisms, and elements of human mate selection preferences.












 Holland¡¯s Hexagonal Theory had only been extensively tested in the West, and for this reason, this study investigated the applicability of Holland¡¯s Model in Hong Kong. In particular, it examined (1) the environment¡¯s classification that reflects the population in Hong Kong, (2) the relationship between three different congruence index measurements, and (3) the correlation between congruence and job satisfaction. Methods: The subjects were 70 registered nurse and 80 secondary school teacher. The Holland Personality Codes was identified by applying the Self-Directed Search (Form E). Environmental Assessment Technique (EAT) was used to identify the Occupational Codes of the sub-environment in Hong Kong. Moreover, Z-S index, C-index, and K-P index were used to measure the congruence indices. Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire was used to measure subjects¡¯ job satisfaction in both intrinsic and extrinsic dimensions. Results: Major findings included: (1) identifying the sub-environment by EAT was important, (2) the correlations between congruence indices and job satisfaction yielded mixed results, and (3) job satisfaction might be confounded by other factors. Discussion: Future study may use new congruence index measurements and may focus on studying specific occupations.

This study examined the direct and indirect effects of life management strategies (SOC) on life satisfaction through the participation and satisfaction of leisure activity among elderly people in Hong Kong. Methods: A convenience sample of 100 community-dwelling retired elderly people (aged 60 or above) in Hong Kong were interviewed. Regression analyses were carried out to extract the standardized beta weights for testing the direct and indirect effects of life management strategies (SOC) on life satisfaction of older adults. Results: The frequency and satisfaction of leisure activity, life management strategies (SOC), and life satisfaction were all significantly and positively intercorrelated. Multiple regression analysis showed both direct and indirect effect of life management strategies (SOC) on life satisfaction through the participation and satisfaction of leisure activity, with the direct effect being more prominent. Discussion: The results offer a better understanding on how the participation and satisfaction of leisure activity among elderly people in Hong Kong would moderate the relationship between life management strategies (SOC) and life satisfaction. The results reflect that it is worthwhile to encourage elderly people to engage in leisure activities and to enjoy in it, as this would enhance their life satisfaction.










The present study investigated the effects of self-esteem, parental attachment, and peer influence on deviant behavior among Hong Kong adolescents. Methods: A total of 421 students from secondary school Form 2 to Form 4 (244 boys and 169 girls) completed a questionnaire consisting of 4 scales: the Chinese Adolescent Self-Esteem Scales (CAESE), the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA), the Susceptibility to Peer Pressure (SPP), and the Deviant Behavior Checklist. Results: Statistical analyses showed that both self-esteem and parental attachment were not related to deviant behavior. However, when self-concept in domain specific was put into consideration, family self-concept was found to be negatively correlated with deviant behavior, whereas social self-concept was found to be positively correlated to deviant behavior. With respect to parental attachment, significant negative relation was found between the subscale of trust and deviant behavior. Among self-esteem, parental attachment, and peer influence, multiple regressions analyses indicated that peer influence was the best predictor of deviant behavior. Discussion: The results have important implications for parents, teachers, social workers, and policy makers who are concerned with the problems associated with deviant behavior. Appropriate interventions focusing especially on peer influence may be set up to prevent deviant behavior.










This study examined the effect of stress on memory impairment by inducing acute stress on healthy human participants. Methods: A total of 46 participants from Hong Kong were randomly assigned to either the stress group (i.e., mental arithmetic with loud noise) or the non-stress group. Within each group, participants were randomly assigned to either the declarative (i.e., explicit; conscious recollection of learned information) or the non-declarative (implicit; retrieved information without conscious or explicit access) memory test. The psychological stress levels of the participants were measured with the Mood Rating Scale immediately before the stressor, immediately after the stressor, and 15 min after the stressor. Results: The results confirmed the priming effect for the implicit memory recall. However, it did not show any adverse effect of stress on the explicit memory performance. No difference was found between the stress and non-stress groups on almost all the stress levels showing different areas of emotional feelings when measured at different point in time. Discussion: The verbal functions of the participants may be responsible for producing the priming effect and the failure of the cognitive impairment. Chinese materials should be developed and used to assess the verbal declarative memory performance of Chinese/Cantonese speaking people. Standardization of research paradigms should be developed and more cultural and language awareness is needed in order to promote the reliability and validity of future results.









This study examined whether the Big Five Personality Inventory, currently used in many organizations¡¯ selection batteries, is as capable of predicting job performance of Customer Service Representatives (CSR) in offshore call centers as it is of other people-oriented occupations. Methods: Survey questionnaires were distributed by two administrative assistants to CSRs with at least one year of tenure as performance appraisal was conducted on an annual basis. A total of 101 questionnaires were completed. The survey assessed their personality by the Big Five Personality Inventory, their job performance by subjective measurements (i.e., evaluations by their team leaders and supervisors), and their job performance by objective measurements (i.e., the average number of calls handled per hour, the number of compliments, and the number of complaints received). Results: Consistent with the hypothesis, Extraversion, Conscientious, and Openness to Experience were associated with job performance judged by supervisors. Agreeableness and Neuroticism did not yield any statistical significant effect on any of the performance dimensions. None of the Big Five personality dimensions yielded any correlations with the objective measures of job performance. Discussion: This analysis shed light on the use of personality measures for personnel decisions in large organizations, particularly with CSRs. By selecting and hiring those who possess personality characteristics that are related to quality service and employee performance, level of customer satisfaction can be enhanced.











The present study compared the self-esteem of Comprehensive Social Security Assistance Scheme (CSSA Scheme) elder recipients with that of eligible but non-CSSA elder recipients. Respondents¡¯ perception and importance of others¡¯ (i.e., family members and mass media) view on CSSA recipients and their effects on the self-esteem of CSSA and eligible non-CSSA elder recipients were also examined. Methods: Questionnaires consisted of items that assess the perception and importance of family members¡¯ and mass media¡¯s view on CSSA and non-CSSA elder recipients, items that measure self-esteem, and items that assess the demographic information of the respondents. Among the 73 completed surveys, 49 valid cases were chosen to be analyzed. The participants chosen were 49 Chinese elderly aged 60 to 79 years, of either CSSA recipients or eligible non-CSSA recipients. Results: As expected, the CSSA elder respondents had lower self-esteem than the eligible non-CSSA elder respondents. A positive correlation was found between the others¡¯ view on CSSA recipients and the self-esteem of CSSA respondents, irrelevant to the level of importance of others¡¯ view to them. In contrast, no significant correlation was found between the others¡¯ view on CSSA recipients and the self-esteem of eligible non-CSSA respondents. However, if only non-CSSA respondents who valued highly on family members¡¯ view were considered, a significant negative correlation was found between their perception of family members¡¯ view and their self-esteem. Discussion: There are practical implications from the present study for the provision of social security for elders in Hong Kong. Merely meeting the financial needs of those in poverty is insufficient, it is also necessary to take care of their psychological needs.









This study examined the effects of three types of instructions on creative performance, which was operationalized as divergent thinking in terms of fluency, flexibility, and originality. Methods: One hundred and sixty-eight undergraduate students from two Hong Kong universities completed questionnaires that consisted of a creativity personality traits list, four divergent thinking tasks, and a demographic data part. The creativity personality traits list comprised of four subscales of different personality traits: (1) Chinese creative personality traits, (2) Chinese personality trait, (3) Western personality traits, and (4) Western creative personality traits. The four divergent thinking tasks were two verbal and two visual tasks with either ¡°be creative¡± instructions, ¡°be practical and reasonable¡± instructions, or standard instructions. Results: Results showed that there was no significant difference between the divergent thinking scores of the groups working under ¡°be creative¡± instructions and standard instructions. However, detrimental effects on divergent thinking scores were found in the group receiving ¡°be practical and reasonable¡± instructions. No gender difference was found in the fluency and flexibility scores, but males outperformed females in both areas of verbal and visual originality. Positive significant correlations were found between Chinese creative personality traits and divergent thinking outputs in verbal fluency and verbal flexibility, but not in visual tasks and originality. Also, a positive significant correlation was found between motivation and creativity performance. Discussion: The lack of incremental effect of ¡°be creative¡± instructions on divergent thinking outputs seems to have theoretical implications, that creativity is not a transient state but a long-standing trait.










This study investigated the relationship between TV viewing habits of Hong Kong children and their creativity level. It also examined the effects of parental guidance in children¡¯s TV viewing behaviors and children¡¯s non-TV viewing activities. Methods: A total of 98 primary school Grade 2 children participated in the study. A revised version of the Wallach-Kogan creativity tests was employed to measure participants¡¯ creativity level. In addition, the participants¡¯ parents completed a questionnaire to assess participants¡¯ TV viewing habits. Results: Results showed that heavy TV viewers scored lower than moderate viewers on the verbal and figural scale of the creativity test. Heavy viewers of violent programs were less creative than their moderate viewer counterparts, whereas moderate viewers of non-violent adults programs were more creative than their heavy viewer counterparts. Moderate viewers with parental monitoring and moderation scored higher on the verbal creativity scale than their heavy viewer counterparts. Results of hierarchical linear regression analyses showed that father¡¯s education level and parental monitoring were positive predictors of children¡¯s creativity, whereas parental moderation was a negative predictor of children¡¯s creativity. Discussion: The results demonstrate the importance of TV viewing habits on children¡¯s creativity level. Parents may improve children¡¯s creativity level, by limiting the time children spend on TV viewing to prevent displacement effect, and by stimulating children to choose programs that enhance, or at least do not interfere with, creativity.

This study examined the relationship between creative work environment, creative self-efficacy, and job satisfaction among two medical professions. Methods: The participants were 61 allied health staff in two medical professions from the same hospital, namely physiotherapist (n=26) and radiographers (n=35). They completed a questionnaire that assesses creative work environment, creative efficacy, job satisfaction, and demographic information. A pilot test was carried out to confirm the internal consistency of the revised Western scales used in the local study. Results: The Cronbach¡¯s coefficients alpha were high ranging from .75 to .90, indicating high internal consistency and reliability of the items in the scale. The results suggested that physiotherapists perceived their work place as more creative, had higher level of creative self-efficacy, and had higher job satisfaction than radiographers did. Creative work environment was found to be a good predictor of participants¡¯ job satisfaction and creative self-efficacy level. Also, the interactive effect of perceived creative work environment and creative self-efficacy on job satisfaction was found to be non-significant. Duration of professional service had no effect on participants¡¯ creative self-efficacy level. In addition, the creative work environmental subscale ¡°pressure¡± and ¡°encouragement for creativity¡± were shown to be the most prominent factors responsible for the differences in the perception of creative work environment between the two medical professions. Discussion: Promoting a creative work environment in medical field is as important as in other work fields, since such environment enhances staffs¡¯ job satisfaction and creative self-efficacy level. Most importantly, it has been shown that job satisfaction and job performance are correlated (Iaffaldano & Muchinshy, 1985). This two-way buffering effect may result in the improvement of hospital service to patients.













 The present study explored the effect of particular personal goals on individuals¡¯ coping outcome. In particular, it examined which and how personal goals, as a personality factor, would enhance resilience in stressful work situations. Methods: A total of 31 teachers were recruited from three different Hong Kong secondary schools of different bandings. Participants were assessed of their level of stress by the Teacher Stress Scale (TSS) and of their psychological distress by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Based on their stress exposure level and reaction level, they were stratified into four subgroups with particular attention given to the vulnerable group (n=9) and the resilient group (n=6). Their reasons for being a teacher were analyzed qualitatively, as the manifestation of personal goals at work. Results: A significant positive correlation was found between participants¡¯ GHQ and TSS scores. Significant differences were found in GHQ and TSS scores among the four subgroups. That is, the grouping method had successfully distinguished ¡°resilient¡± participants from ¡°vulnerable¡± ones. Although there was no statistically significant difference between the vulnerable and resilient group in particular goals, there were some observable differences in the distribution of personal goals among the two subgroups. More goals were related to materiality among the resilient group, whereas more goals were related to personal well-beings among the vulnerable group. Discussion: The findings suggest the importance of personal goals on coping outcome. The identified patterns of goal pursuits at work provide inspiration that help explain participants¡¯ resilience and vulnerabilities in stressful work situation. People who find themselves having difficulties at work might consider re-evaluating their goals at work.














 The study examined some of the consumer behaviors in children, particularly, their saving patterns, product selection, information search when purchasing, and price-value understanding. Methods: The present study was a cross-sectional research based on data collected from a self-administered questionnaire and structure interviews. Both quantitative data from the questionnaire and qualitative opinions were collected from 111 school-aged children. Results: Saving rate was found to be decreasing with age, while gender exerted no effect on saving rate. The types of product bought varied according to age groups. More information was searched when the money was obtained from job rewards than directly from pocket money. However, no difference was found in information search between purchasing goods for themselves and for others. Discussion: Since the saving rate decreases as children grow, children in early childhood should be encouraged to establish good saving habit and consumer behavior. Moreover, the high perspective taking skills of young Chinese children in production selection and information search is proposed to be originated from the Chinese authoritarian parenting style instead of voluntary self-initiate action. Educational or social programs are recommended to be conducted in classrooms to encourage children¡¯s autonomy.












This study investigated the connection between the conflict management style and the relationship satisfaction of Chinese dating couples. Methods: Participants were 127 Hong Kong Chinese who were involved in a dating relationship for more than 1 year when the study began. The Relationship Assessment Scale, Rahim¡¯s Organization Conflict Inventory, and a self-derived scale measuring attachment to Chinese values were administered to the participants. Results: The results supported that compromising and collaborating style in conflict management were associated with higher relationship satisfaction, whereas avoiding the conflict adversely affected the relationship satisfaction. The attachment to Chinese values was connected with a greater use of compromising style rather than avoiding style in managing intimate conflicts. Males were found to utilize more avoiding and compromising strategy and less competing strategy than females. Discussion: Some practical implications can be drawn from the present results for dating couples. Since collaboration is associated with increased relationship satisfaction, collaborating style of conflict management should be encouraged in managing intimate conflicts.

Also, a positive significant correlation was found between motivation and creativity performance. Discussion: The lack of incremental effect of ¡°be creative¡± instructions on divergent thinking outputs seems to have theoretical implications, that creativity is not a transient state but a long-standing trait.















This study examined the effects of cultural orientation (individualism vs. collectivism) and positive performance feedback type (individual vs. group) on achievement motivation and attributional beliefs (internal vs. external). Methods: The participants were eighty 10-year-olds to 12-year-olds Hong Kong Chinese children. They completed a questionnaire that assesses their cultural orientation, attributional beliefs, and perceived causes of achievement. Then, they were assigned into 4 groups with different combinations of positive performance feedback type. Half-way through a perceptual task, participants received positive performance feedback according to their experimental condition. After the perceptual task, participants completed a questionnaire regarding their attributional belief. Children¡¯s achievement motivation was measured by the choice of task and the accuracy of work throughout the perceptual task. Results: The results revealed that both individual and group positive performance feedback, compared to no feedback, increased achievement motivation. Also, it was found that positive performance feedback was associated with internal attribution (i.e., attributing success or failure to effort and ability). Contrary to the expectation, group feedback did not enhance collectivists¡¯ achievement motivation. The individual feedback was found to be the most effective in enhancing achievement motivation for both individualists and collectivists. In addition, collectivists were found to have higher achievement motivation than individualists, and they attributed more success or failure to internal causes. Discussion: The findings suggest that the nature and the availability of feedback can directly influence or enhance Hong Kong Chinese children¡¯s achievement motivation.

This study examined the effect of stress on memory impairment by inducing acute stress on healthy human participants. Methods: A total of 46 participants from Hong Kong were randomly assigned to either the stress group (i.e., mental arithmetic with loud noise) or the non-stress group. Within each group, participants were randomly assigned to either the declarative (i.e., explicit; conscious recollection of learned information) or the non-declarative (implicit; retrieved information without conscious or explicit access) memory test. The psychological stress levels of the participants were measured with the Mood Rating Scale immediately before the stressor, immediately after the stressor, and 15 min after the stressor. Results: The results confirmed the priming effect for the implicit memory recall. However, it did not show any adverse effect of stress on the explicit memory performance. No difference was found between the stress and non-stress groups on almost all the stress levels showing different areas of emotional feelings when measured at different point in time. Discussion: The verbal functions of the participants may be responsible for producing the priming effect and the failure of the cognitive impairment. Chinese materials should be developed and used to assess the verbal declarative memory performance of Chinese/Cantonese speaking people. Standardization of research paradigms should be developed and more cultural and language awareness is needed in order to promote the reliability and validity of future results.










This study tried to understand idol worshipping attitudes in adolescence. In particular, it examined the relationship between idol worshipping attitudes and gender, age, fan club membership, and academic achievement. Methods: Participants were Hong Kong secondary school Form 1 to Form 7 students, aging from 11 to 21 years old. Four hundred and eighty-seven participants were randomly selected from four secondary schools (Band 1 and Band 5). They completed questionnaires that assess their attitudes on idol worshipping and their demographic information. Results: The results showed that gender and academic achievement have no significant effect on idolatry attitudes in adolescence, whereas age showed a slight significant effect. Fan club membership yielded most significant effects, thus it is a useful measure of idolatry involvement. In addition, significant positive correlations were found between various categories of variables on idol worshipping attitudes. Also, half of the top 10 favorite idols were local Chinese pop singers. Adolescents were more attached to idealism-romanticism-absolutism oriented celebrities. Discussion: Fan club membership is a crucial factor affecting idol worshipping attitudes in adolescence, and this effect is assumed to be due to peer pressure. Given the popularity of idolatry behavior, members of a group are motivated to adhere to what is perceived to be the group norm to avoid peer rejection.

This study investigated the relationships of ICQ usage with introversion-extroversion, loneliness, social support, and perception of intimacy with ICQ partner. Gender differences were also examined among these factors. Methods: The participants were 120 Hong Kong tertiary undergraduate students. They completed questionnaires that assess the level of introversion-extraversion, loneliness, social support, intimacy, ICQ usage, and demographic information. Then, they were categorized into high (n=35) and low (n=85) users of ICQ. Results: The personality dimension of introversion-extroversion and level of loneliness were found to be unrelated to ICQ usage. Nevertheless, a positive relationship between ICQ usage and perception of intimacy with ICQ partner was substantiated. Moreover, an interaction effect was found between ICQ usage and participants¡¯ gender on social support received. That is, gender differences were found on perceived emotional support and cognitive guidance with varying ICQ usage. Contrary to previous studies, no gender difference was found among the ICQ users with respect to the level of introversion-extroversion, loneliness, social support, and perception of intimacy with ICQ partner. Discussion: As the participants in the present study are not required to report their gender identity on ICQ, the results might be complicated by the possibility of gender switching. It is possible that the users pretended to behave like their opposite sex and therefore be treated differently by their ICQ partners. The effect of gender switching on maintaining relationships on ICQ also deserves attention in the future.

The present study aimed to (i) identify personality dimensions that are salient to the Hong Kong Chinese context on the basis of a taxonomy developed by Lai, Luk, and Wan (2002) using the approach of Implicit Personality Theory (IPT), and (2) to examine the congruence between the structure of the identified indigenous dimensions and that of the well established Big Five Personality Factors. Methods: A total of 212 participants were requested to rate each trait on a 9-point scale according to how accurate each trait describes themselves (self rating). They were also asked to nominate a peer to complete the same questionnaire. The selected peers were asked to rate each trait according to their knowledge of the participant on how accurate each trait describes him or her (peer rating). Results: Results indicated that 3 emic personality factors were salient to the Hong Kong Chinese, which exhibited a clear social and relationship orientation. Although substantial overlap was observed between these emic factors and the five-factor solutions as derived from the Western Big Five markers, one-to-one correspondence between the two sets of factors was not identified.

Holland¡¯s Hexagonal Theory had only been extensively tested in the West, and for this reason, this study investigated the applicability of Holland¡¯s Model in Hong Kong. In particular, it examined (1) the environment¡¯s classification that reflects the population in Hong Kong, (2) the relationship between three different congruence index measurements, and (3) the correlation between congruence and job satisfaction. Methods: The subjects were 70 registered nurse and 80 secondary school teacher. The Holland Personality Codes was identified by applying the Self-Directed Search (Form E). Environmental Assessment Technique (EAT) was used to identify the Occupational Codes of the sub-environment in Hong Kong. Moreover, Z-S index, C-index, and K-P index were used to measure the congruence indices. Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire was used to measure subjects¡¯ job satisfaction in both intrinsic and extrinsic dimensions. Results: Major findings included: (1) identifying the sub-environment by EAT was important, (2) the correlations between congruence indices and job satisfaction yielded mixed results, and (3) job satisfaction might be confounded by other factors. Discussion: Future study may use new congruence index measurements and may focus on studying specific occupations.












This study examined the viability of major components of the Health Belief Model (HBM), body-image related benefits, and social influence in predicting exercise behaviors. In particular, it is hypothesized that: (1) HBM variables, including perceived health benefits and barriers, are predictive of exercise behaviors, (2) the inclusion of social influence will enhance the overall predictive power of the model, and (3) body-image related benefits will emerge as a reliable predictor in exercise behaviors. Methods: Two hundred and forty-seven Hong Kong Chinese participants completed the Becke Questionnaire of Habitual Physical Activity, the Health Belief Model scale, and the Reasons for Exercise Inventory. Results: Results of hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that perceived health benefits, body-image related benefits, and perceived barriers accounted for 20.3% of the variance in exercise behaviors, even when the effects of major demographic variables were controlled for. Social influence successfully improved the predictive ability of the model by 3.1%. Body-image related benefits, perceived barriers, and social influence, but not perceived health benefits, were reliable and unique predictors of exercise behaviors. Discussion: These results lend support to the utility of the HBM and psychosocial variables (perceived barriers, body-image related benefits, and social influences) to understand and predict exercise behaviors among Hong Kong Chinese.









This study examined the effects of cultural orientation (individualism vs. collectivism) and positive performance feedback type (individual vs. group) on achievement motivation and attributional beliefs (internal vs. external). Methods: The participants were eighty 10-year-olds to 12-year-olds Hong Kong Chinese children. They completed a questionnaire that assesses their cultural orientation, attributional beliefs, and perceived causes of achievement. Then, they were assigned into 4 groups with different combinations of positive performance feedback type. Half-way through a perceptual task, participants received positive performance feedback according to their experimental condition. After the perceptual task, participants completed a questionnaire regarding their attributional belief. Children¡¯s achievement motivation was measured by the choice of task and the accuracy of work throughout the perceptual task. Results: The results revealed that both individual and group positive performance feedback, compared to no feedback, increased achievement motivation. Also, it was found that positive performance feedback was associated with internal attribution (i.e., attributing success or failure to effort and ability). Contrary to the expectation, group feedback did not enhance collectivists¡¯ achievement motivation. The individual feedback was found to be the most effective in enhancing achievement motivation for both individualists and collectivists. In addition, collectivists were found to have higher achievement motivation than individualists, and they attributed more success or failure to internal causes. Discussion: The findings suggest that the nature and the availability of feedback can directly influence or enhance Hong Kong Chinese children¡¯s achievement motivation.










This study investigated the relationships between justifications for extramarital relationships, attitudes towards extramarital relationships, and extramarital involvement among married individuals. In order to provide local data comparable with Western studies, the present research replicated the methodological approach of Glass and Wright¡¯s study (1992) on justifications for extramarital relationships in Hong Kong context. Methods: Three hundred and thirty-four Hong Kong Chinese married individuals filled out a questionnaire that assess their justifications for extramarital relationships, extramarital involvement (both sexual and emotional), compliance with Chinese values, and demographic information. Results: Participants¡¯ attitudes towards extramarital affairs were found to be positively correlated with extramarital involvement. Their level of approval in extramarital justifications was moderated by their gender, justification factors, and actual involvement in extramarital relationship, with the latter one as the major determinant. Men approved more sexual justifications and had more extramarital sexual involvement, whereas women approved more emotional justifications and had more extramarital emotional involvement. Moreover, there was an inverse relationship between compliance with Chinese values and the level of approval in extramarital justifications. Discussion: The present study provides a comparable local data to previous Western research. People who have higher compliance with Chinese values hold more conservatives views toward extramarital behaviors.









 The two studies investigated the influence of both traditional and modernized filial piety on self-disclosure of adolescents in Hong Kong. Study 1 tested Yang¡¯s (1988) theory of filial piety and developed a revised scale. Study 2 examined the relationship between filial attitude and self-disclosure with the revised scale. Methods: In Study 1, 186 university students completed a questionnaire that comprised of the Filial Piety Scale. Twenty filial piety items with the highest mean were extracted from the scale to develop the Revised Filial Piety Scale. In Study 2, 207 high school students completed the revised scale and a measure of self-disclosure. Results: In Study 1, results of factor analysis showed that the 50 items failed to cluster into the 10 factors of filial piety. The results of both studies rejected the hypothesis that there was a significant difference between traditional and modernized filial piety. Both types of filial piety were found to have an impact on adolescents, for participants rated higher on some of the items on both types of filial piety. Study 2 revealed that: (1) adolescents seldom disclose, (2) adolescents disclose more often to mother than to father, and (3) females disclose more often than males. In addition, no correlation was found between filial piety and self-disclosure. Discussion: Based on these results, it may be speculated that the concept of filial piety has been modified and that traditional and modernized filial piety can only be distinguished conceptually. In reality, people may not notice the minute modifications of the concept but rather, they may think filial piety is a unique construct. Different people may be filial at various degrees but may not be dimensionally different.












This study tried to understand idol worshipping attitudes in adolescence. In particular, it examined the relationship between idol worshipping attitudes and gender, age, fan club membership, and academic achievement. Methods: Participants were Hong Kong secondary school Form 1 to Form 7 students, aging from 11 to 21 years old. Four hundred and eighty-seven participants were randomly selected from four secondary schools (Band 1 and Band 5). They completed questionnaires that assess their attitudes on idol worshipping and their demographic information. Results: The results showed that gender and academic achievement have no significant effect on idolatry attitudes in adolescence, whereas age showed a slight significant effect. Fan club membership yielded most significant effects, thus it is a useful measure of idolatry involvement. In addition, significant positive correlations were found between various categories of variables on idol worshipping attitudes. Also, half of the top 10 favorite idols were local Chinese pop singers. Adolescents were more attached to idealism-romanticism-absolutism oriented celebrities. Discussion: Fan club membership is a crucial factor affecting idol worshipping attitudes in adolescence, and this effect is assumed to be due to peer pressure. Given the popularity of idolatry behavior, members of a group are motivated to adhere to what is perceived to be the group norm to avoid peer rejection.









This study explored the applicability of Bartholomew and Horowitz¡¯s (1991) four-category model on Chinese young adults in Hong Kong. In particular, it investigated the effects of four adult attachment prototypes (i.e., secure, dismissing, preoccupied, and fearful) on self-esteem, peer relationship, and family relationship. Methods: One hundred and ninety-two young adults with median age of 28 completed the self-reported Attachment Style Questionnaire, the Chinese version of Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, the Index of Peer Relation, and the Family Adaptability and Cohesion Evaluation Scales. Results: Findings indicated that subjects with secure and dismissing attachment style, both having a positive regard of self, had higher self-esteem than the other two groups that have a negative regard of self. The secure group had the lowest magnitude of peer problem but contrary to the hypothesis, the preoccupied group had the highest magnitude of peer problem. The impact of attachment style on perception of family closeness was not obvious. Family relationship among Chinese seemed to be culturally unique. Discussion: The results suggest that the four attachment prototypes can be identified in Chinese young adults and one¡¯s social functioning is much influenced by the attachment style one belongs to. However, as the Chinese may have some characteristics unique in their culture, a Chinese adult attachment inventory should be developed for further study of adult attachment among Chinese society.












This study replicated previous studies on the effect of family environment on adolescents¡¯ psychological well-being, particularly on their self-esteem. Methods: One hundred and ninety-two Hong Kong secondary school Form 3 to Form 5 students participated in the study. They completed a questionnaire that assesses their family environment and psychological well-being. Results: Family environment was found to be a predictor of adolescents¡¯ psychological well-being and self-esteem. The results revealed that perceived global parenting styles, specific parenting behaviors, and parent-adolescent conflicts were related to adolescents¡¯ psychological well-being. Relative to other family and parenting variables, specific paternal behavior was found to exert a stronger influence on adolescents¡¯ psychological well-being. Discussion: The findings suggest that it is unlikely that a given parent would or should adhere purely to any one style or one behavior, but would or should accommodate the needs of adolescents and the individuality of the adolescent in the process of cultivating a stimulating, encouraging, and healthy family environment.









This study investigated the relationships of ICQ usage with introversion-extroversion, loneliness, social support, and perception of intimacy with ICQ partner. Gender differences were also examined among these factors. Methods: The participants were 120 Hong Kong tertiary undergraduate students. They completed questionnaires that assess the level of introversion-extraversion, loneliness, social support, intimacy, ICQ usage, and demographic information. Then, they were categorized into high (n=35) and low (n=85) users of ICQ. Results: The personality dimension of introversion-extroversion and level of loneliness were found to be unrelated to ICQ usage. Nevertheless, a positive relationship between ICQ usage and perception of intimacy with ICQ partner was substantiated. Moreover, an interaction effect was found between ICQ usage and participants¡¯ gender on social support received. That is, gender differences were found on perceived emotional support and cognitive guidance with varying ICQ usage. Contrary to previous studies, no gender difference was found among the ICQ users with respect to the level of introversion-extroversion, loneliness, social support, and perception of intimacy with ICQ partner. Discussion: As the participants in the present study are not required to report their gender identity on ICQ, the results might be complicated by the possibility of gender switching. It is possible that the users pretended to behave like their opposite sex and therefore be treated differently by their ICQ partners. The effect of gender switching on maintaining relationships on ICQ also deserves attention in the future.

 This study explored the relation between reported stress level, perceived control in the workplace, and usage of coping strategies of employees in a high public performance appraisal situation or high performance visibility situation. Methods: The reported stress symptoms and the visibility scores of 40 professionals in the investment industry in Hong Kong and 40 non-investment professionals were compared. Results: A positive relation was found between the reported stress level and the score on the visibility scale. Despite a higher stress level experienced by employees in high performance visibility jobs, a higher perceived control in the workplace and more usage of coping strategies were found to have a negative relation with the stress level reported. The study also revealed that the most frequently used coping strategies were those focusing on positive reaction approach, which employees seek to work at solving a problem to the best of their ability. Discussion: The results demonstrate the importance of the strategies used in organizations in the investment industry. By adopting appropriate strategies, employees¡¯ psychological and physiological health may be improved substantially.











 This study examined the impact of job insecurity and job strain on psychological well-being. Methods: A total of 96 participants completed questionnaires that assess their job insecurity, job stress and job satisfaction, life satisfaction, and psychological distress. Job insecurity was assessed by the quantitative and qualitative job insecurity model of Hellgren, Sverke, and Isaksson (1990), job stress and job satisfaction were measured by Job Demands/Control model developed by Karasek (1979), life satisfaction was measured by the Satisfaction With Life Scale, and psychological distress was measured by the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Results: Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that job strain and qualitative job insecurity were reliable and unique predictors of both job satisfaction and life satisfaction. Psychological distress had no significant association with any of the predictor variables. Qualitative job insecurity had greater impact on predicting job satisfaction than quantitative job insecurity. That is, the sense of threat of impaired quality in employment features affected the life and job satisfaction level of the present young and well-educated sample more than the threat of the future loss of the present job. Discussion: The findings imply that the loss of job features may be more important than the loss of continuity in the job itself, therefore it is more important for organizations to maintain a sense of qualitative job security. This relationship is of interest to managers in organization around the world, because organizations with satisfied employees tend to be more effective than organization with unsatisfied employees.













This study examined whether the Big Five Personality Inventory, currently used in many organizations¡¯ selection batteries, is as capable of predicting job performance of Customer Service Representatives (CSR) in offshore call centers as it is of other people-oriented occupations. Methods: Survey questionnaires were distributed by two administrative assistants to CSRs with at least one year of tenure as performance appraisal was conducted on an annual basis. A total of 101 questionnaires were completed. The survey assessed their personality by the Big Five Personality Inventory, their job performance by subjective measurements (i.e., evaluations by their team leaders and supervisors), and their job performance by objective measurements (i.e., the average number of calls handled per hour, the number of compliments, and the number of complaints received). Results: Consistent with the hypothesis, Extraversion, Conscientious, and Openness to Experience were associated with job performance judged by supervisors. Agreeableness and Neuroticism did not yield any statistical significant effect on any of the performance dimensions. None of the Big Five personality dimensions yielded any correlations with the objective measures of job performance. Discussion: This analysis shed light on the use of personality measures for personnel decisions in large organizations, particularly with CSRs. By selecting and hiring those who possess personality characteristics that are related to quality service and employee performance, level of customer satisfaction can be enhanced.










 Holland¡¯s Hexagonal Theory had only been extensively tested in the West, and for this reason, this study investigated the applicability of Holland¡¯s Model in Hong Kong. In particular, it examined (1) the environment¡¯s classification that reflects the population in Hong Kong, (2) the relationship between three different congruence index measurements, and (3) the correlation between congruence and job satisfaction. Methods: The subjects were 70 registered nurse and 80 secondary school teacher. The Holland Personality Codes was identified by applying the Self-Directed Search (Form E). Environmental Assessment Technique (EAT) was used to identify the Occupational Codes of the sub-environment in Hong Kong. Moreover, Z-S index, C-index, and K-P index were used to measure the congruence indices. Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire was used to measure subjects¡¯ job satisfaction in both intrinsic and extrinsic dimensions. Results: Major findings included: (1) identifying the sub-environment by EAT was important, (2) the correlations between congruence indices and job satisfaction yielded mixed results, and (3) job satisfaction might be confounded by other factors. Discussion: Future study may use new congruence index measurements and may focus on studying specific occupations.










This study examined the relationship between creative work environment, creative self-efficacy, and job satisfaction among two medical professions. Methods: The participants were 61 allied health staff in two medical professions from the same hospital, namely physiotherapist (n=26) and radiographers (n=35). They completed a questionnaire that assesses creative work environment, creative efficacy, job satisfaction, and demographic information. A pilot test was carried out to confirm the internal consistency of the revised Western scales used in the local study. Results: The Cronbach¡¯s coefficients alpha were high ranging from .75 to .90, indicating high internal consistency and reliability of the items in the scale. The results suggested that physiotherapists perceived their work place as more creative, had higher level of creative self-efficacy, and had higher job satisfaction than radiographers did. Creative work environment was found to be a good predictor of participants¡¯ job satisfaction and creative self-efficacy level. Also, the interactive effect of perceived creative work environment and creative self-efficacy on job satisfaction was found to be non-significant. Duration of professional service had no effect on participants¡¯ creative self-efficacy level. In addition, the creative work environmental subscale ¡°pressure¡± and ¡°encouragement for creativity¡± were shown to be the most prominent factors responsible for the differences in the perception of creative work environment between the two medical professions. Discussion: Promoting a creative work environment in medical field is as important as in other work fields, since such environment enhances staffs¡¯ job satisfaction and creative self-efficacy level. Most importantly, it has been shown that job satisfaction and job performance are correlated (Iaffaldano & Muchinshy, 1985). This two-way buffering effect may result in the improvement of hospital service to patients.

The present study examined the relationship between parental behaviors (demandingness, responsiveness, and involvement) and adolescents¡¯ self-concept. The effect of gender, family type (intact and divorced), and schooling cohort on the relationship was also examined. Methods: The sample consisted of 141 male and 87 female adolescents, with 119 in Form 1 and 109 in Form 4. The 228 participants were administered questionnaires that assess their demographic characteristics, their perception on their parents¡¯ parental behaviors, and their self-concept. Results: Significant relationships were found between parental behaviors and adolescents¡¯ self-concept. More specifically, a significant and strong relationship was found between parental responsiveness and involvement and adolescents¡¯ self-concept facets. In addition, family circumstances and schooling cohort were found to have an effect on the relationship between parental behaviors and adolescents¡¯ self-concept. However, the influence of gender did not exert a significant effect on the relationship. Discussion: Parental behaviors are very important in contributing to the growth of adolescents¡¯ self-concept. For continuous development in self-concept, parents and adolescents should be aware of their roles in parenting and develop open communication through the practice of parental responsiveness and involvement.

The present study investigated the effects of self-esteem, parental attachment, and peer influence on deviant behavior among Hong Kong adolescents. Methods: A total of 421 students from secondary school Form 2 to Form 4 (244 boys and 169 girls) completed a questionnaire consisting of 4 scales: the Chinese Adolescent Self-Esteem Scales (CAESE), the Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA), the Susceptibility to Peer Pressure (SPP), and the Deviant Behavior Checklist. Results: Statistical analyses showed that both self-esteem and parental attachment were not related to deviant behavior. However, when self-concept in domain specific was put into consideration, family self-concept was found to be negatively correlated with deviant behavior, whereas social self-concept was found to be positively correlated to deviant behavior. With respect to parental attachment, significant negative relation was found between the subscale of trust and deviant behavior. Among self-esteem, parental attachment, and peer influence, multiple regressions analyses indicated that peer influence was the best predictor of deviant behavior. Discussion: The results have important implications for parents, teachers, social workers, and policy makers who are concerned with the problems associated with deviant behavior. Appropriate interventions focusing especially on peer influence may be set up to prevent deviant behavior.









his study examined the effect of stress on memory impairment by inducing acute stress on healthy human participants. Methods: A total of 46 participants from Hong Kong were randomly assigned to either the stress group (i.e., mental arithmetic with loud noise) or the non-stress group. Within each group, participants were randomly assigned to either the declarative (i.e., explicit; conscious recollection of learned information) or the non-declarative (implicit; retrieved information without conscious or explicit access) memory test. The psychological stress levels of the participants were measured with the Mood Rating Scale immediately before the stressor, immediately after the stressor, and 15 min after the stressor. Results: The results confirmed the priming effect for the implicit memory recall. However, it did not show any adverse effect of stress on the explicit memory performance. No difference was found between the stress and non-stress groups on almost all the stress levels showing different areas of emotional feelings when measured at different point in time. Discussion: The verbal functions of the participants may be responsible for producing the priming effect and the failure of the cognitive impairment. Chinese materials should be developed and used to assess the verbal declarative memory performance of Chinese/Cantonese speaking people. Standardization of research paradigms should be developed and more cultural and language awareness is needed in order to promote the reliability and validity of future results.










The role of memory, reasoning, and perceptual speed in learning of Chajei were studied among people with lower intelligence (i.e., mentally retarded) and those with normal intelligence. Methods: Eighty-two participants completed questionnaires that assess participants¡¯ reasoning, perceptual speed, speed of long-term memory retrieval, speed of short-term memory scanning, and decision speed. They were also given a typing test to assess their accuracy and typing speed. Results: Results showed that working memory (both retrieval speed and accuracy), reasoning, and perceptual speed were significantly poorer in people with lower intelligence. However, for these individuals, only reasoning was correlated with their proficiency in using Chajei. On the other hand, only the speed of long-term memory access was correlated with proficiency in using Chajei for people with normal intelligence. Discussion: The reasoning threshold hypothesis is proposed, which suggest that only when one¡¯s reasoning above a certain threshold can one be able to learn Chajei. But when one¡¯s reasoning is above the threshold, the speed of long-term memory access becomes critical to the performance in using Chajei. As reasoning is a relatively stable cognitive component, Chajei may be too difficult for people with mental handicaps. Therefore, other ¡°easier¡± Chinese Character Input Method may be taught to them.









This study examined the mental health and self-esteem of unemployed Hong Kong Chinese in comparison with their employed counterparts. In addition, time structure and perceived social support of the unemployed were studied. Methods: A total of 115 participants of different age groups, including 52 unemployed and 63 employed, completed a questionnaire that measures their mental health, self-esteem, time structure, and perceived social support. Results: As predicted, the unemployed participants had poorer mental health but not significantly lower self-esteem than their employed counterparts. Results also indicated that among the unemployed, those with better time structure and more perceived social support enjoyed better mental health and higher level of self-esteem. Discussion: The role of better time structure and social support may be incorporated in intervention programs as useful coping resources for the unemployed individuals.
