
 I've been worked in this branch company for half a month.During this working time,I have learn some knowledge of computer and I have reviewed the basic knowledge that I studied in my school time.
Thanks for my colleagues' help ,all my colleagues are so friendly and passionate.Since I am new here,I need to learn many things about our company ,our products,our work,our colleagues and myself.It doesn't matter that I can't get a high salary at the moment.Because the most important of my work is to improve my work skills and enrich my knowledge.Moreover,I should work hard and keep learning new knowledge all the time.
   From now on,I am not a student any more but a young English editor.I can support myself now and in the future I should support my families.Although I have little power ,have few money,have few experience, I can change this situation  several years later.If I keep this in mind and to do my work with perseverance,I can obtain what I want some day.I hope I can do something wonderful for my families ,my motherland,the people I love and myself.
   As I have so many goals,I need make some good plans for these goals.Maybe I will encounter numerous obstacles,therefore I must go to forward bravely.I'm believe in myself,I can make my dreams come true.I think I am a lucky dog and I will catch the happiness.I desire happiness all my life!







 It's sunny,flowers are smile under the sky.I feel spring is beside us,I can smell it,I can touch it,I can see it.Everything goes fine.I feel so happy!What a nice day!Now I need to work hard ,so I have few time to write more.But I will try my best to write more .Moreover, I should keep writing everyday ,I must write as more as I can.I hope I can do it step by step so that I can success at last!
  Today I should stop here,because I have to work.It's time to work now!












 I get a blog now ,but I do not know much about it.Then I will learn it  by myself,maybe I will get a hard work,but i don't care.Just do it ,you can success at last if you have perseverance.
     Now i am working in a small company as an english editor,I'm new here.Thus ,I need to learn many things about my work and my colleagues.I hope I can do a good job and make friends with my colleagues in the furter.I will try my best to do !
