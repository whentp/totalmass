This work reports the corrosion behavior of nanotubular oxide layers on Ti-29Nb-xZr alloys with different compositions by anodization in 1 M H3PO4 + 0.8 wt% NaF. Depending on the alloy composition, nanoporous or highly ordered nanotube structures can be formed. The nanotube oxides on the Ti-29Nb-xZr alloy showed lower corrosion current density compared to non-treated sample.
