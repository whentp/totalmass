A dance education system that works with a marker-based motion capture system was built. Students are able to learn dancing without presence of teachers. The system combines motion capture technology and OpenGL animations to provide students an intelligent and effective learning environment. The system plugs in a motion data handler and a real-time motion data handler from systems MocapViewer v1 and Simulation of Scenes with Multiple Densely-Interacting Characters (SSMDIC) respectively. Combining an evaluator for motion analysis, students can watch demonstrations of different dance motions and discover their errors in dance performance immediately without the presence of teacher. Survey results showed that most users agreed that our proposed system can help them to learn dancing efficiently. Experiment results showed that feedback given by our system can assist students to get improvement in dance learning.







In a nutshell, it is inconvenient for comic readers to perform a scene search on large volumes of comic pages, as a conventional way to achieve the task is to perform brute force searching based on the vague impression of searchers. With the emergence of e-comics, computers could be designed to achieve the search task by comic characters indexing. The search of characters under different occasions will be helpful in identifying which scenes are the craved ones by narrowing down the scope from the large amount of digital comic pages in the database. To be able to differentiate between various cartoon characters for indexing, a content based image retrieval (CBIR) system is developed for the sake of comic readers. Under this project several detection and recognition strategies would be investigated to determine which algorithms, when being applied on e-comic data set, are more workable. After the comparison on the workable face detection and recognition algorithms were done from the literature, some of them have been culled to experiment on the comic data set. Overall 7 algorithms (3 for detection and 4 for recognition) are selected to work on the experiments, and the most workable methodologies are found to be Adaboost (detection) and Elastic Bunch Graph Matching [EBGM](recognition), yielding a rate of 45.50% and 54.44% respectively. To compensate for the imperfectness of the detection rate, the CBIR system developed are embedded with a modification function for users to add in undetected faces as for input in recognition; where to improve the recognition result, some knowledge from the comic nature are utilized as to boost the performance of EBGM, resulting an increase of 38.79% from the original recognition rate, the overall recognition first-rank rate is finalized as 75.50%. Although the performance is still not 100% accurate, the CBIR system might be able to search the specific scene if users provide more information to it. The CBIR system deployed is also designed in such a way that, if being used continuously, the performance of recognition will be enhanced.








Buses transportation system is one of the busiest systems in Hong Kong, according to Hong Kong Yearbook 2007, franchised buses takes up about 34% of the total daily transport volume, which carries about 4 million passengers per day. Although, it provides service with efficiency to citizens in Hong Kong, people still come across the time when they miss a bus and spend a long time queuing at the bus stops. Real time passenger information systems have been adopted for a decade in most parts of the Western Europe and Japan for providing bus arrival information. However, actual implementation schedule of those real time information systems in Hong Kong is still remain an uncertainty. Nowadays, a substantial number of smart phones have the multimedia ability and geo-locating ability. Some of the mobile phone users would use 2G technologies to get access to the Internet while they encounter weak connectivity and poor browsing experience. Furthermore, they lack the positioning device, the Global Positioning System (GPS). This project is aiming to implement a Bus Arrival Predictor on the platform of Google AndroidTM that can provide relevant bus route information with bus arrival time to users. The project explored the great flexibility and capability of the first Google AndroidTM powered mobile phone, HTC G1TM. Moreover, different development platforms and prevalent bus arrival prediction algorithms are briefly discussed, including Kalman Filter, Automatic Vehicle Location (AVL) and Automatic Passenger Counters (APC). In completing the project, different technologies like AGPS, location detection, route finding and estimated time of arrival will be examined. What¡¯s more, inherited shortage of the evolving Google AndroidTM, such as the lack of walking directions, will be addressed and solution suggested. The ultimate goal of this project is to provide an inspiration of further development on future mobile real time passenger information system, and suggest ways to overcome current limitations.









t is a trend for people to travel on their own without joining the travel agents in recent years. Travelers would take a map and search for sites to visit. However, reading a paper map is inconvenient and difficult sometimes. With the technology of GIS and GPS, there have already been maps on the Internet. To meet the requirement of mobility of travel guides, maps have to be implemented on handheld devices. There have been some applications with GIS on PDA or pocket PCs. They mainly provide location based or map based query, however, there is a lack of location detection or tracking functionality. Even though some applications can support GPS and provide routing function, they are useful for drivers only. They are not suitable for ordinary visitors to travel in highly dense areas like Hong Kong. This project aims to implement informative maps on PDA-phones such that it can provide users¡¯ positioning. SIM tracking mechanism provided by SUNDAY LBS is chosen to be used. The auto-detection of current location together with a destination input by the users, an optimal path could be calculated and displayed on a map to teach the users to go to the place. Moreover, audio and photo display functions would also be provided. The deliverable will be of web-based such that dynamic update of data can be available and no software deployment is required for clients. Throughout the project, technologies in location tracking will be examined. Also, technical problems on path finding, route instruction generation and web UI of PDA-phones will be justified and overcome. The project would be useful for the development of located based applications on handheld devices and could be acted as an extension to provide map information.











While a lot of people have heard about ¡°distance learning¡± or ¡°distance education¡±, elearning nowadays is a new term which enables knowledge transfer in a completely different way. Not only students, children in kindergartens also benefit from IT technologies. Since education raises the demands for e-learning platforms for children, tremendous amount of applications have been created for this purpose. This trend also leads business enterprises to investigate on different e-learning materials creation tools, especially when game-based learning has become a trend in children¡¯s learning. Today, there are a plenty of learning games creation tools available on web. However, each platform has its specific formats and standards which impede the reusability, customizability and interoperability of the created learning materials. It then gives rise to the need of an environment for easier creation and maintenance of such learning game materials. To cope with existing needs, a flexible environment based on framework LCMS (Learning Content Management System) is created in this project. LCMS is a framework that provides a platform to create, modify and deliver the learning contents. By applying popular question types and structured Web Services for flash communication, this environment creates a fast and effective way to make learning games for teachers and standardizes a formal data linkage into flash for educational games developers. As children education put much emphasis on vocabulary learning, this project development will focus on the construction of a development portal for two purposes: (1) To help developers to construct words teaching games and (2) to help teachers to maintain and share learning contents. The main functions of the platform are to provide an API and vocabulary management facilities for programmers and teachers to create their own words learning games. These will be achieved by developing a LCMS structured authoring portal and learning object repository.

User privacy, which concerns about compromising the identities of network users and tracking user¡¯s movement and whereabouts, has become one of the big issues in network especially wireless networks along with the increased requirement of user mobility and sensitive data application. An Anonymous Authenticated Key Exchange for Roaming (AAKE-R) which involves a user and two servers, namely a home server and a foreign server, is an authenticated key exchange scheme, which achieves user anonymity and user untraceability by keeping user¡¯s identity secret from any other third party except home server. This scheme also manages to carry out authenticated key exchange between the user and the foreign server with the contribution of home server, at the same time, makes the session key unobtainable for the home server to achieve the data privacy. This project will provide an instance of AAKE-R protocol with the consideration of key-privacy, real-time run environment, and computational constraints. Moreover, a PC-based application will be built to verify the correctness and realistic of the protocol.

With the growth of Internet use and e-commerce, the entire Internet community is familiar with phishing attack. While spam is an annoyance in nowadays, phishing attacks can cause the major financial disruptions for those victims. Lots of anti-phishing systems have been developed to fight against phishing attacks. We, the AntiPhishing Group [8], have implemented an anti-phishing tool, SiteWatcher Client, too. However, those anti-phishing systems including ours may block certain phishing attacks, but not all. After studying, it is proposed to develop a smart server support for SiteWatcher Client in order to increase the accuracy in phishing detection. SiteWatcher Server is involved to support the client application. Based on the study of the SiteWatcher Server, it ensures the value of the server support to SiteWatcher Client.

The proposed solution is designed on top of the existing anti-spam technologies that unauthorized messages are eliminated. Existing anti-spam technologies can still be applied to further improve the performance. The implementation is a complete email system including: Email Client, Email Server and Key Management Server which ensures the security of the authentication process. Feasibility and practical issues are also demonstrated in the system architecture.









The Smart Recognizer (SR) is deployed as a speaker-dependent small-vocabulary speech recognition on mobile devices. The system can be easily reconfigured to work with arbitrary vocabularies. Applications of inputting Short Messages and operating by voice are built based on the algorithm. SR gets the MFCC features of voice signals, and utilizes asymmetric DTW to do feature matching. By carefully design, the memory requirements of the SR should fit to the average amount of today¡¯s mobile phones and PDA, and the recognition precision is more than 85%.








With the growth of Internet use and e-commerce, the entire Internet community is familiar with phishing attack. While spam is an annoyance in nowadays, phishing attacks can cause the major financial disruptions for those victims. Lots of anti-phishing systems have been developed to fight against phishing attacks. We, the AntiPhishing Group [8], have implemented an anti-phishing tool, SiteWatcher Client, too. However, those anti-phishing systems including ours may block certain phishing attacks, but not all. After studying, it is proposed to develop a smart server support for SiteWatcher Client in order to increase the accuracy in phishing detection. SiteWatcher Server is involved to support the client application. Based on the study of the SiteWatcher Server, it ensures the value of the server support to SiteWatcher Client.

The project divide in two parts, the first part is to develop a smart card operating system and the second part is to write an application interface. First, write a smart card operating system to control the read, write of the EEPROM area of the smart card. In my operating system, there are totally 2 modes, issuer mode and user mode. These two modes define two different ways of protecting the card. The issuer mode can have higher privilege than the user mode. It is used to initialize and personalized of the card. After the card release to user, it will change to user mode, this mode cannot change to issuer mode because a logical fuse is ?¡ìblown?¡§ and it is irreversible. The user mode has more limits to access the read write of EEPROM area of smart card. Second, the application interface is used to communicate with the smart card through a suitable card reader. It is used to write the data to, to get the data from the smart card. The interface sends the suitable command (APDU commands) to the smart card, and then the operating system gives back reply and the interface receives it.











Java Card is a multi-application environment, which was enabled by the Java Card Virtual Machine (JCVM). It is widely used in third-generation cellular phone nowadays, and is likely to dominate the mobile market in the next decades. The demand for its development then becomes higher and more rapid. One of the key components in Java Card is the operating system because it is responsible for the communication between the Java Card Virtual Machine (JCVM) and card reader. The operating system is built on top of JCVM to manage and control the user applications. It main functions include command dispatch, card content management and security management. This project is to design and develop an operating system of Java Card based on Open Platform Card Specification V2.0.1.

Speaking E-Book system is specially designed for visually impaired persons to allow them to listen to what desires to read. System, users only need to use their own voice to command and control the operations without requiring any other inputting device. In order to broaden area of contact to acquire knowledge for users, the system is integrated with e-mail and Internet capabilities allowing users to enjoy benefit of the up-to-date technology, Internet and E-Mail. As a result, the whole system can be divided into three sessions - E-Book, E-Mail and Internet session. In the E-Book session, there are two E-Books, "Basic law of Hong Kong" and "Romeo and Juliet", included for users to read. "Basic law of Hong Kong" is presented by a user-defined voice to speak out the book?|s content. However, "Romeo and Juliet" is a play script chosen to increase users' interest in reading. In other words, the whole E-Book / "Romeo and Juliet" is dialogue based that each character has his/her own voice to speak out each script line. In the E-Mail session, through speech medium users can send e-mail by inputting subject, e-mail address and content. Besides sending e-mail, users can receive e-mail from others, read all e-mail within the mailbox and reply these e-mails as he/she wishes. For the last Internet session, users can input any universal resource identifier into the system and it will try to filter out some unwanted materials e.g. HTML tag or web programming script. Then, speak out the Internet text resource for user.









The objectives of my project are to design a head of a model and generate some special functions or effects by writing ActionScript of FLASH MX. These functions are generated for the user to use and control, for e.g., changing the color of the model, changing the size of some parts of the head and changing the facial expression etc. In addition, different type of hair and different shape of face have been produced for the user to change such that the user can generate different model. Also, some backgrounds with different weathers have been designed to make the project more attractive and the user can also make control on them. Another function of written ActionScript of FLASH MX is to link different actions or figures together to let them move effectively and do some special effects. Finally, a note, a phone number list, a simple mp3 player and some sounds have been made.

ActionScript is the scripting language of Macromedia Flash. A scripting language is a way to communicate with a program, you can use it to tell Flash what to do and to ask Flash what is happening as a movie runs. This two-way communication allows me to create interactive multimedia movies. This program is developed using Flash and ActionScript. The aim of this program is to educate children. After using this program, the user will have a clear concept about human face, what are the appearance and the name of some type of jobs through controlling many interactive and animated movies. The characters will even speak to the user. In the program, ActionScript use to control the operation of all the components, so that the user can select different parts from a set of buttons to create the character and can drag and drop the parts by using a mouse. Also the ActionScript uses to control the sequence of the movies.











In 21st century, computer software are required to solve problems efficiently. These problems change everyday, thus software update are rapidly. However, the software, written by structural programming, is difficult to update. As a result, Object Oriented programming is introduced. This programming provides a great flexibility to update the software. But the current computer architecture like Complex Instruction Set Computer (CISC) or Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) is shown inefficiency to execute Object Oriented program. Therefore, innovative computer architecture, High-level Instruction Set Computer (HISC), is developed. HISC is an Object Oriented Descriptor computer, it is a developing machine that uses the concepts of the object oriented programming in hardware level. It is composed of three units: Instruction Unit, Storage Unit and Execution Unit. In this project, I am responsible for the implementation of the Storage Unit of the machine. The Storage unit is divided into two parts: Operand Descriptor Cache and Data Cache. These two caches are three-port caches in order to fetch three data as short as possible. To implement my design, Hardware Description Language (VHDL) and Field Programmable Gates Array (FPGA) are used. One of the objectives of this project is to demonstrate the advantages of Object Oriented Descriptor computer compared with the current architecture, like RISC or CISC, in future.

Nowadays, the modeling of 3D human is one of the most challenging problems in computer graphics. However, a realistic deformable 3D human body [1] is rarely seeing in the virtual reality field. It is because we can easily model static 3D objects but it is difficult to create a realistic deformable 3D human model. Simple polyhedral models, curved surfaces, and even finite element models are used to represent human frequently in video games, movies and TV commercials. Although researchers have devoted significant efforts to represent and deform human body shape, the problem of realistic animation of human body has not yet been satisfactorily solved. Two major challenges are: the modeling of realistic body models; the automatic and realistic deformation of body skin envelope when the human figure is under movement. Due to the high desire of users, the quality of graphical devices becomes more and more high. The Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) modeling technique is outdated, and mesh modeling technique with deformable feature meets exactly these demands. Therefore, using mesh for the realistic human modeling dominates the market. Also, many different modeling languages can be used for 3D implementation, but for simplicity OpenGL Modeling Language in Visual C++ are used in this project. Deformable human modeling and animation are carried out on each constituent part, including head and neck, arms and hands, chest and abdomen, legs and feet. Several animations such as walking, high jump, long jump and physical exercise are designed. A GL menu control panel is provided for the users to choose their desired animations and keyboard can control each separated body parts interactively.

The project aims to develop a tool that can perform automatic analysis and summarization of soccer videos. Soccer is the most popular sport in the world. Many soccer videos are produced. Traditionally they are analyzed manually but it costs valuable time. Therefore it is necessary to have a tool that does the job automatically. The analysis includes some low-level processing algorithms such as grass field detection, shot boundary detection and shot classification, as well as a higher-level algorithm for penalty-box detection. First, the tool detects the grass field by finding the green pixels that form a large continuous region. Next, the tool detects the shot boundary by comparing the grass pixel ratios and similarity of color histograms of consecutive video frames. Then, the tool classifies the video shots by looking at the grass ratios of the frames in each video shot. After that, the program detects penalty-box by the three-parallel-line rule. Lastly, two types of summaries are produced. They are the soccer match play-break classification and the total time of offence of each team. The first type is based on the result of shot classification and the second one is based on the result of penalty-box detection. The effectiveness of the tool is demonstrated over soccer videos from different countries. The tool performs very well as its analysis results achieve high accuracy. Therefore it is possible letting the computer to analyze the soccer videos itself.












The major objective of this project is to build a content-based image retrieval system with use of the MPEG-7 technology. This system also has a very user friendly web-based interface. The main function of this system is to search similar pictures in a large image database by using images features descriptors such as color and texture, which defined in the MPEG-7 standard. Features of each picture in the image database are first extracted and presented in a compact form by extensible XML language, which could effectively increase the searching speed. In this project, a novel color searching algorithm called Key Color Descriptor was also developed and implemented in the system besides thebasic content descriptors defined in MPEG-7. This new searching method is implemented according to the MPEG-7 specification; it can match similar color images by means of color quantization and palette merging. Experimental results show that the proposed KCH descriptor achieves more precise retrieval result than the MPEG-7 Dominant Color descriptor. Moreover, we revise the similarity measure of Dominant Color Descriptor into MPHSM. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves higher precision and recall rate than original one. A novel approach of relevant feedback was also implemented in this system for improving the retrieval accuracy.

In the modern mass communication, video walls are effective tools to communicate with people. You may find them in the various exhibitions. Companies like to use video walls to demonstrate their products, and people like to use video walls to pursue higher visual enjoyment. There are many reasons for developing a new video wall system. For example, the traditional video walls are too expensive and they are lack of applications. As a result, we need to find a solution to overcome these drawbacks. In this project, we aim to build a PC cluster video wall system. The cluster is called Abacus which is a supercomputer designed for multimedia applications. Linux Operating System is chosen as its¡¯ stable system and high performance. Besides, we have used some open source libraries to complete this project, for instance SMPEG, SDL and LAM/MPI. The communication method used is to send message among the network. We have applied two techniques to synchronize the network, one is barrier synchronization and the other one is continuously monitoring. CityWall, raises the novel idea that we can build a low-cost software video wall with PC cluster to suit the increasing demand. It has a lot of advantages. It is purely software based which makes it be low-cost and high-efficiency. It is very portable on the Unix-like environment as its¡¯ cross-platform libraries. Also, it is an open source project that we can contribute to the society. In addition to the standard video player functions, we have implemented some applications on it such as filtering, zooming, panning, and interpolation. To sum up, this is a very challenging project that we need to explore the possibility of implementing software video wall, but I have successfully overcome a lot of difficulties and found out the solutions to those technical problems. My four achievements are (1) configured a video wall system, (2) developed a video wall model, (3) developed a video wall MPEG player, and (4) enhanced the quality and functionality of the system.

In today¡¯s business environment, most of the companies that were currently under development afford some types of data access. As increasing numbers of developers adopted the client/server model as the basis for their applications, the choice of servers and the architecture of servers became much more important to the overall success of enterprise-wide computing. In addition, as more businesses depend increasingly on technology to bring users and information together, to streamline processes, and to decentralize decision-making, distributed client/server computing provided the necessary connection between data and informed business decisions. In order to assemble and analyze the information from different areas, database should be built. A database was a collection of information organized in such a way that a computer program can quickly select desired pieces of data. We can think of a database as an electronic filing system, or a phone book. Moreover, a computer database can be put up on the World Wide Web for data retrieval.







As the multimedia technology is widely used in the world, people can use computer to generate 3D animation. Because of this advanced technology, programmers can use the better software to make vivid movies with sound. The project goal is to create a 3D talking head that can speak using Cantonese like human. It is divided into three main processes. First, the user can input the Chinese words in the voice generator. It will generate the corresponding voice and data file. Through the programming technique, the 3D head is lip synchronized with the voice given. Making a 3D head is necessary to use powerful 3D drawing software MAYA 4 as a helping tool. The 3D head is built up in MAYA 4 environment. Through the blend shape function in MAYA 4, the talking head can have different mouth shapes. The lip synchronization of the talking head with the given voice is done by MAYA scripting language ¡°MEL¡±. In the program, Chinese words get the parameters from the voice generator. The visemes of the Chinese word then find their corresponding mapping codes of mouth shapes. After finishing the mapping process, the program lip synchronizes the mouth shapes with the voice. Finally, an AVI video of the Talking Head can be produced in MAYA 4.







This project aims to build a 3D animated talking head, which base on English, and the interface to control the 3D head. That means user can control the 3D head to talk with the speech given. After input the sound file and the text, a movie of the 3D talking head with the input can be produced. And the 3D head is lip synchronized with the speech. It is implement by using powerful 3D Drawing software ¡°MAYA¡±. The 3D head is built up in MAYA environment and using the deformation function in MAYA to deform the 3D head with different mouth shapes. The user interface and the function for producing the 3D talking head movie is written by MAYA script ¡°MEL¡±. There is also a C program is used for converting the English text into the corresponding Phoneme. Finally the 3D head and the interface are built up in MAYA. The 3D talking head movie with the speech input can be produced. The accuracy of the lip synchronization and comparability of the mouth shapes is acceptable.









The project presents how to construct a 3D model by an active vision system. It is divided into two parts, which are software and hardware. In the software part, calibration and rectification will be demonstrated by two images. After that, feature points will be found out; these points will be used to produce the disparity map. The disparity map will be then used to deduce the 3D model of the example. There are two hardwares in the project, which are the pan tilt unit and the camera. They are controlled by the serial port of the computer. The driver of them is done by Visual Basic programming.








The project proposes a 3D geometry reconstruction of the scene from video. A number of images would be captured from a video, and dense matching algorithm would be used to reconstruct the scene. In that algorithm, Feature tracking and image rectification also would be involved in the project. And then derive depth maps from image sequences. Once the depth map is computed, the intensity and depth at these locations are used to reconstruct arbitrary views of the 3-D scene. Finally, triangular mesh and texture mapping are used to show the 3D object.








Nowadays, some traditional controllers in various electronic products such as television, air conditioner, mp3 player, mobile phone, etc, fully concentrated on using buttons or rolling keys, are not convenient enough for the disabled. It is high time that introduced a new method - motion movement. Users can simply selected any options by some specific hand motions. Furthermore, in the 3D control application or Virtual Reality (VR) space, it is difficult to move an object by just using traditional input equipments such as mouse and keyboard. In order to have more accurate, sensitive, special and specific movement instructions, 3D Motion Capturing Device must be used. Users can move by hand and object will have the same movement simulation. To get a better result in the 3D motion capturing, a wireless transmission is needed as a user can feel free to control 3D Motion Capturing Device with a smoother motion. Using a wire controller, users should keep in stay a fixed point. On the other hand, without wire limitation, users can keep the controller and work within a fixed location such as in a house or office. To compare with the wire one, they can get the same result (control some specific devices) with a more convenient way by wireless technology.

The objective of this project is to develop a content-based 3D object model retrieval system by making use of the shape features such as distance, curvature and surface normal. Also, provide a convenient way for users to search similar 3D models in the database more efficiently. The use of surface normal is to shortlist the models from the database. This can reduce the computation time in the later stages. There are two methods for calculating distance. Method 1: Distance is the calculation of the length between a vertex of the object model and the object centre being measured. Method 2: First determine the number of sampling points and find coordinates of each sampling point on the surface of a unit sphere. Then, shoot imaginary rays from each sampling point to the centre of the unit sphere. Compute intersection points and calculate distances between the centre of the sphere and the intersection point on the object surface. Curvature is the measure of the vertex angle of the object model. To retrieve the most similar models, the query is compared with each instance of the database using these shape features. The VRML 2.0 File Format 3D models have been used as the testing data. These models are stored in a 3D model database with extracted shape features. After testing the program with the 3D models in database, I found that the rating for curvature distribution and distance distribution is a great factor that affects the retrieval result. Therefore, a suitable rating will give you a reasonable result. The detailed result will be described in the report.











For Internet users who are interested in 3D graphics, they may dissatisfy in finding high quality 3D graphics in the Internet. Since without using a workstation with high level of configuration, it is expensive and time consuming to build up a 3D model, especially for a human model. In this project, we aim to provide a 3D human model with animation that is saved in small files. The users can save time to download and executed the program in their computers. Moreover, the program can be executed interactively on-line using relatively low processing time. Although Broadband service becomes more and more popular, due to the high service charges, still many users have to cope with the 56K modem. The Non-Uniform Rational B-Spline (NURBS) modeling technique meets exactly these demands. Therefore, NURBS technique for the human body modeling, Mesh for the human head modeling, Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) for the modeling language, and JavaScript for the programming language, are used in this project. Human modeling and animation are carried out on each constituent part, including head and neck, arms and hands, chest and abdomen, legs and feet. Several actions such as walking, running, sit up and basketball playing are designed. A control panel is provided for the users to choose their desired actions and the mode of action.











Nowadays, the 3D models are widely adapted in many applications such as video games, movies and TV commercials. The traditional way to construct a 3D model is using 3D software by professional artist. It cannot be easily done by untrained people. Therefore, my project applies another method to recover the 3D shape from images, which can simplify the modeling process. In this project, we aim to present an approach for shape recovery based on integrating geometric and photometric information. We try to recover 3D bilaterally symmetric objects from a single image. The symmetric property provides us geometric information and the intensity image provides us photometric information. The basic idea is that an image can be regarded as a pair of images. Each image of the pair is half of the object with different viewing and lighting directions since it is a bilaterally symmetric object. By integrating the photometric and geometric information can yield a dense correspondence between pairs of symmetric points, and a result, a dense shape recovery of the object.









In the project, the developed game engine is specified for first personal shooting game. In the game engine, a player can choose a character (model) and a level to play with. It provides a battle field for multi-player through network and supports up to 8 players at the same time. A basic control system is developed which supports attack, jump, walking upstairs, changing viewing angles and switching weapons. A basic weapon system is developed which supports 2 types of weapons. They are rocket and fire gun. There is also a particle system used to generate fire and explosion.






Nowadays, MPEG 1 Layer 3 (MP3) player has become popular. Except playing the song, most MP3 player consists of other functions in order to make it more user-friendly. For example, the song information and the status of the MP3 player is commonly displayed in Liquid Crystal Display (LCD). Moreover, Universal Serial Bus (USB) is a common plug-and-play interface between a computer and add-on devices. The data-transfer rates are up to 12 Mbps. So a USB Mass Storage Device Driver is implemented in MP3 player. When the MP3 player is attached to personal computer (PC), the PC can automatically detect it as a USB Mass Storage Device. A new removable disk is created and the user can easily manage the files in the MP3 player.








The aim of the project is to develop a computationally simple frequency estimation method based on a modified linear prediction technique. Its performance will be contrasted with other conventional approaches for different applications such as speech coding and power line monitoring. The proposed estimator with be tested with the existing estimators with different length of samples, signal to noise ratio, frequencies, computational complexity and different types of noise through computer simulation using MATLAB. Moreover, the proposed estimator will be extended to the signal model with damping ratio. The new estimator will be tested with different signal to noise ratio, length of samples, frequencies and damping ratio. Furthermore, signal consists of two sinusoids will be investigated and the performance of estimations by different estimators will be compared.








Electronic inertial measurement components, which sense both acceleration and angular rate, are being used to detect motion of an object more frequently as their cost continues to drop dramatically. An Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) will consist of two kinds of sensor, which are gyroscopes and accelerometers. Gyroscope is used to find out the orientation of an object and accelerometer is used to find out the displacement of an object. IMU is different from other motion detection technology such as infrared ray, which requires external signal to detect motion; as such kind of system is completely self-contained. ?£¤Self-contained?| means that there is no need external information from outside world in order to accomplish the detection. In this project, an IMU will be intended to detect human motion.








High bit error rate is one of the major factors that affect the performance of wireless local area networks (WLANs). This project intends to solve the problem by using parallel wireless links between a mobile station and multiple access points. Also, A dispatching algorithm is proposed to balance the load on the parallel links. By using this algorithm, we can expect that the data transmission can finish at the earliest possible time. Performance comparison between the use of single link and parallel links is performed. It shows that the use of parallel links can give a more steady performance. Furthermore, the throughput of the proposed algorithm is compared with the other commonly used dispatching algorithm. It shows that the proposed algorithm gets higher throughput in most cases.








The main objective of my project is to simulate a cloth model that is being placed on irregular shaped objects and can interact with moving objects. This project follows the previous project entitled "Modelling and Animation of Cloth". For this project, I have studied some conference papers, journal papers and books on the simulation of cloth model. After the literature search, I started to implement the simulation with a plug-in in 3D Studio Max 5. The plug-in uses using Visual C++ to implement. The method uses in the simulation is based on calculating the change of velocities of particles of cloth to estimate the next position in geometric space. Also, the collision detection prevents the intersection of the cloth and the object.









IP routers use packet classification to support advanced functions such as quality of services (QoS), virtual private networks (VPN), firewalls, and access control. The rules used for classifying packets are called filters. A filter is made up of multiple header fields, e.g. the source IP address, destination IP address, protocol type, and/or port number. The packet classification problem is to determine the best matching filter (the highest priority filter that matches the packet's header fields) in a filter database. In real life, a filter database may have over 10,000 filters. The challenge of the problem is the tight real-time requirement. To match the speed of a gigabit backbone router, the packet classification algorithm is required to sustain a throughput of several millions classifications per second.








The project aims at introducing a new fair queuing algorithm for wireless networks. The algorithm should maintain the fairness among sessions and efficiency. In this project, a new notion of fairness will be introduced. The ¡°fairness¡± will be divided into two parts: short tern and long term. In short term, the algorithm will maintain effort fair in which the session bandwidth mainly depends on the wireless conditions. In long term, it will maintain throughput fair in which every session will finally have the same throughput. For the efficiency, the algorithm may be as simple as possible that may decrease the runtime of it and the resource of the system. Finally, a simulator will be programmed to test the throughput and actual delay of this algorithm.







a technique for locating face region using image processing, counting the number of people walking across the area, and the analysis of movement of people as recorded by a camera. The speed of computation must be fast enough for real-time application. Before starting the analysis, a chroma chart for the skin colour region in the CIE L*a*b* colour model is prepared. Afterwards, background subtraction is carried out to reduce the computational time and improve the accuracy for the subsequent operations. Pixels of the remaining areas, which are the potential face regions, are converted to 8-bit values representing the likelihood of skin colour. The skin regions can then be detected by an adaptive segmentation. Facial feature detection or shape analysis is carried out to verify whether the skin regions are faces or not. It is suggested to use shape analysis rather than facial feature detection because of the complexity of the latter approach. Some basic mathematical morphologic methods have been introduced for the preprocessing of the image. In the current stage, the system can locate all skin colour regions of an image sequence and form a complete shape for face analysis.










Microarrays are one of the latest breakthroughs in experimental molecular biology. It allows monitoring of gene expression for thousands of genes in parallel and providing large amount of valuable data. Clustering analysis is one of the methods to excerpt the contained biological information with arranging genes according to similarity in pattern of gene expression. Since biologists may be difficult to extract the biological information with the raw microarray in mathematics format, the output is displayed graphically, conveying the clustering and the underlying expression data simultaneously in a form intuitive for biologists. Hierarchical clustering and k-mean clustering is one and the best way to extract the information from the microarrays. In this project, a graphical user interface with a helpful toolbox is provided for the user to analyst the data. Further investigation of the measurement of proximity is also included in this project.








In the past decades, the field of digital watermarking for copyright protection of different multimedia data has gained widespread popularity as research topics. Digital watermarking is a technique to embed some security messages into the multimedia data by slightly modifying the data. Those security messages can be text or image. In this project, the security analysis of different digital watermark embedding and extraction methods is firstly done. In most of the existing methods, it is found that even if we do not have correct key, the embedded content can be easily obtained. Traditionally, to solve this problem, some extra operations like bit relocation can be applied. However, this will introduce problems such as extra storage needed. We will focus on the scalar quantization based method and try to increase the robustness by increasing the number of lookup tables and interval decision.









This project develops a video player on mobile devices using Java 2 Micro Edition (J2ME) technology. It aims to enable telecom operators and content providers to deliver rich multimedia content to java enabled mobile phones. Two different video formats are used in my project. One is called Java Video which is used in slow mobile devices, while the other is called 3gp which is used in faster mobile devices. In this project, two video players were written: "Java Video Player" and "3G Video Player". The Java Video Player is a MIDP-1.0 compatible J2ME video player. Due to the hardware limitation, a new video format called Java Video is developed as well. Java Video is a self-defined video format and its main characteristics are simple and efficient decoding algorithm. The 3G Video Player is a MIDP-2.0 compatible J2ME video player. It can playback 3gp video format. It requires much more processor power but has a better quality.
