What is the salary, how do you evaluate salary. I think salary is an affirmation for you, your ability. It is a crystal for your effort in a certain time. No matter what you have done is good or bad, much or less, you will receive a share of salary for you. Of course, the reverse situation will occur, if you are not lucky, for example, unfortunately you are in an "animal" company. Many staffs are your enemy.
Someone are the slave of their salary. After receiving the salary, they would like to deposit it in the bank. Despite of the things they are very interested in, they won't pay it off. There are many reasons perhaps, for instance, they have to accumulate enough money for their children, they are affraid of that something difficult to forcast happen, or they just treat the money as their " parents"........
Someone are the god of their salary. They like to empty the money they have just received to do what they like. For those people, they have the ability to enjoy life. They are in the comfortable life. However, when some unpredicting things come, they are in the hole.
For me, I prefer the second opinion. But I fear for that a little. I have no idea, but accepting the reality. Sometimes, I have to save some money for rain day. Ohoh, for the remainings allowed to be spend, I will use them up as soon as possible. The precondition is that this thing is worth to use my salary. Maybe this is not a good habit, ,, My friend, what are your opinion?

Everyone knows that sprot is good for life, but less people would like pay more time on it. As soon as they got disease, they will say " I shoud have done some exercise.......". I want to say that it is no use to emphasize on it again and again, the only thing you can do for the good better is to practise. Otherwise shut up!!!!
Today, I went to play basketball with my colleagues again. It is a very comfortable feeling after the basketball playing, even though it is very tough when playing basketball. In my opinion, sport is not only a physical exercise, but also a spirite process, and a good opportunity for making friends. Unfortunately, I sprained my ankle today, but I don't complain about it, I think it is worth to do it, even if I was wounded. After using the Yunnan Baiyao, I feel better now from my ankle. 
My dear friends, take my advice please. Doing more exercise is surely useful to your life, your career, your family, your future, ........















Living in this world, you will find that there are so many bother things you have to face. How to overcome them, I think handling the good communication skills is the best way to solve these problems.
Some people alwasy neglect improving their oral expression, further speaking, they are unwilling to pay more time on training they communication skills. When they are in the hole, they just complain "this is unfair". For example, their boss give an opportunity to them for the purpose of checking their strength. This time, they have to give a speech on the public occasion where there are hundreds of people presented. In this moment, they can not open their mouth, because they never think "speaking" will beat them before, always spend their more time on the reading and writing etc. In this way, what is the result about their future who neglect "speaking", which is very obviously.
Take my advice please, my friend, find a way, create a way to advance your oral skills to communicate with others, your relatives, your friends, even the strangers. Along with time goes by, you will notice that it is going to bring more benefits to you. ..........

The mood is just like the blowing wind, existing around you wherever and whenever, influencing all the things concerned you. The mood can infect other people, all the persons about you and all the things about you. I donn't know if you have this kind of feeling, originally speaking,  you are softhearted, but you become very impetuous suddenly by some unknown reasons. Yes, this is the fault that the mood bring to you.
In my opinion, the people's mood can be affected very easilly by the outside things, and the power of the mood is too strong to image. When you are in the bag mood, you have treated your best friend as the enemy; you even smash the most beautiful things you think before.
My dear friends, trust me please! Taking the good mood to deal with every matter you have to face, you life will become better and better.










CRH, namely, China Railways Highspeed. It is the highest speed rain in the current world. Comfortable, fast, safe is its merit. I think everyone who have already experienced it will give a A to it. CRH is the key for someone who would like to transit himself quickly from the departure point to the destination. Taking it, we can save a lot of time, meanwhile enjoy the high quality service. Every thing has its advantage and disadvantage.
The tickey price, yes, ticket price is the biggest embarrassment for all the people who want to take CRH. For some common people, their income is not enough to pay CRH, for them, they would rather take some slow train for the purpose of saving money.  For you, what is your choice?

In this blog, or next, I want to introduce some materials concerned Japanese. Since my seconed language skill is Japanse, and now, Japan is one of the developed countries in the world, I think we should know something about them.
The reality is that Japan is a county we dislike by some history reasons. However, If you want to win, you have to know all the things around you. I can understand many people who are rejecting Japanese goods or culture, but my suggestion is that we should know something about them. My friend, do you agree with me.










All the people know that Japan is a nation that can accept anything, as long as it is useful for them. After Meiji reform, Japan began to change their style gradually. They wore the business suit, ate western food and build skyscraper. In short, they want to learn all the useful things and manners from the countries which is stronger than them.
Language is a very important thing in understanding each other among the countries. Japanese began to creat a lot of  "new English" by katakana, which is known as loanword. They would rather say ¥°¥Ã¥É¥â©`¥Ë¥ó¥° instead of ¤ª¤Ï¤è¤´¤¶¤¤¤Þ¤¹in the morning, especially in the young people group. There is so many examples here, thank you©`¤¢¤ê¤¬¤È¤¦©`¥µ¥ó¥­¥å©`, shoping©`¥·¥ç¥Ã¥Ô¥ó¥°©`ÙI¤¤Îï¤·¤Þ¤¹. Japanese language become more and more useful, in this way, Japanese benefit more in international trade.
My dear friends, what can you realize from this kind of phenomenon.











Now, on whatever media, the housing price is a very popular topic. Why it is so hot. The reason is that there is a very important and complex relation between you and it. Now matter who you are, whatever you do, you cann't escape from it. It will always pester you, you even cann't breath, at last, you give up and give the way of it.
As the humanbeing, the difference with the animal is that we have our own emotion and life goal. But most of us live under the peacockery. They just like to compare with others, their friends, relatives, colleagues. As an old saying goes," never to compare with others, you just yourself!", they just would not like to accept it.It this way, they are always in trouble, in bothering.
In the metropolis like Beijing, ShangHai, DaLian, buying a suitable huse is a beautiful dream. Some people say that making a loan is good choice. I want to ask you that do you compare your income with the current situation you have to face? A person are not living is the vacuum, your money must be cut into several shares as soon as you get it. After analyzing it carefully, some people have to choose leave. Some one keep on staying, among them, some are lucky who married with the local people, some one keep on searching, some go astray,,,,
Dream is a double edge, some people benefit from it, some one is hurted by it. Handling our dream smoothly is the key. Wake up, wake up, my friend!!!









That Career is the salt of life is a very popular and old saying, which is well known by all the people around China, even all around the world. However, currently speaking, I always find that many people give their complaining frequently to their job, ( of course, including me), af if they can live better without the work. Sometimes I thik that humanbeing is a kind of animal too. The more they possess, the worse they feel (which is not suitable for all the people perhaps.)
As for me, I have just experienced this.
I work in a state-owned company, in which all the staff enjoy the annual leave. About twenty days before, I asked it. I feel very excited before I start my holiday, and have already made severy good plan for this. But the thing not goes like what I think. Just several days passed, the desire for the holiday like before have been reducing. Thank for the works " career is the salt of life", I woke up.
If you want to possess a wonderful life, you must try you best to do something for it, otherwise, shut up! Ok ! I got it. There are so many things I can do for colouring my life. Playing the basketball, swiming, travelling, writing blog, chating with friends on line, reading some professional books, doing some kindness things etcs, which are all the meaningful things I can do.
To sum up, if you you can treat everything significative as the career, you will harvest many good dream more that you can think.










Some people donn't believe that they can make money online, actually speaking, not only can you do it, but also there are many ways can be choosed by you. As a online money maker, I would like to share my idears with you.
1, Internet professional consultation.
You can give the consultation from every aspect, because of that no one comment on one topic, which not means that which topic needs not consultation. However, the advance research is still necessary.
2, Internet free designer
There are many web designers on the internet who are hunting job and searching the customers. The portable web design tools made this career more suitable for digital work.
3, Virtual secretary
Campared with the frash web job, the virtual needs to do some work concerned amanuensis and administration net work, but which can not bring more money for you. It is a very good choice for some one in work who want to earn some extra gains.
4, Being eBay sale elite
Authough what sale elite done are always concerned something, buying with a chearper price and selling by higher, but what we should not ignore is that it is just this way that made the thousands of small enterprises.
5, Creating a charge member BBS
Provide a BBS for consultation, in addition, open a professional part for the VIP members. Through sharing and discussing your best secrets, cluing and suggestions etc, you can earn a lot of Vip charge.









Everyone has the experience of facing loneliness, but not everyone can overcome it.
Loneliness not means the independent living, and going and coming yourself. Living yourself only cann't bring you the loneliness feeling, but living in the focus of the public, you will get that feeling perhaps.
A famous physiologist said that the real loneliness always are on those couples that only touch by the body not feeling and idea communication.
As a matter of fact, no matter you are married or un married, in the crowd or not, as long as you lack of understanding all the things around you and cann't communicate with the environment your are in now, you will tast the feeling of loneliness.
My dear friends, do you have any know-how to overcome the loneliness? Tell me please, thank you.













For a woman, the most important topic in life is always love. Woman think and understand this world by sensibility, while man judge and deal with the relationship between theirselves and this world by various real benefits.
In my opinion, all the embarrassment, pain about woman are from the confict between their own life consciousness and man right culture.
Man said: man can marry and possess dozens of women, while woman must obey the three obedience and the four virtues.
Man said: if a man is powerful sex, he must be a real man, but woman must be feeling not sex, otherwise she is shameful.
Man said: the most import thing for a man is career, woman baby and family' life.
To sum up, leaving in this world, whatever you are man or a woman, you have to obey the comman rules. Otherwise, you will be hurted vehemently. Around us, there are many examples like this, the woman want to change their role, being an able woman, finally, they always are in dilemma even a spinster; A man who just want to take advantage of the woman cann't get a good result, even be killed finally. In this way, man should give woman the most sincere feeling, so do the woman. If either of you lies, both of parties will be hurted, as least one side. Now matter male or female, the key for you is sincere heart!












I have ever read one short phrase, which always encourage and assist me, make me use the positive attitude to face the people and things. The words is "living in the indebted world, appreciate those who have ever hurted you, for they promoted your wisdom; appreciate those who stumble you, they strengthen your ability; appreciate the people abandoning you, they educate you that you should be independence; appreciate the people cheating you, they expand you sight; appreciate the people hurting you, they refined your willpower..........."
As a common person, I know that understanding these words above is very simple, but very difficult to do it in the real world. Yes, we should indebte many things, only in this way, can we see ourselves clearly, and know this society well.
However, in the current situation, many people do not know these kinds of words, and they have various quillets. They take for granted what their parents and friends do for them. They are too selfish, only enjoy asking not giving. Once they wake up, all the things have been gone, which is a very true reflection of the current situation. My friends, I am not lying













In the current society, whoever and wherever you are, you have to obey one rule, "being modest one", if you donn't want to walk in a bend road. Of course, I am only talking on the situation of our country, China.
Talking the manner getting along with people, "modest" play a very important role for you. If you are conceit and cockiness, the final result for you is to lose you basis of social ability, and be loneliness for ever, everyone will abuse you. 
I think the following ideas is very useful for the wise people,
1, Never look down on anyone,
2, Never forget who you are, even if you are in the time of your success,
3, Never boast your ability, for the persons will find it when the time is coming. ( Giving the opportunity to the third part, let all the people around you know your ability naturelly, that will be better.)
4, Never mind who are your teacher, as long as he/she has the merit you should learn.
Yes, speaking easily doing difficultlly. My friend, do you have any novel idears, share them please!!!















Along with the the accelerating life style, many people have been ignored physical exercise. I donn't tihnk this is a wise trend. As the people living in the current society, I think a good health body is more important than everything. However, the people are omitting this more and more, only when they got the disease, they complain that which is unfair. Sometimes I am the one among them, but now, I wake up again.
Several days ago, I caught a cold. At that time, I wonder why I caught the cold and not recover quickly, this situation never occurs frequently before. After visiting the doctor, I got the answer, I didn't do the physical exercise suitablely. Yes, I agree with that, these time, I alwasy over work. 
Today, I went to the JiangWan big bridge exercise play ground. Watching the scene of many people playing basketball, I cann't help myself, but joining the game. At that moment, I found that I must train my-self for I have backslided for both of my physical force or professional basketball skill. I should show that I am a basketball athlete before like what I have written at my unfinished bolg. After this basketball match, I feel like I am resetted. Dispite of tired feeling, I write these.
Treat your life well, neve be the slave of your life, my friends, donn't you think so?











When all the people are enjoying the wonderful World Cup, the unhappy things are happening in the south of our motherland, I cann't help but writing something about that.
From the Flood defense administration in JiangXi province, up to 9 clock am. 20th, there are 180 thousands people are besieged by the flood. Currently speaking, ZiXi and YingTan, some other counties in JiangXi province 
are facing the serious matters of breaking off in communication, transportation and water supply, the daily life of the people living in that area is suffering seriously, the worst thing is that some mountain area cann't
be communicated. 
At this crucial moment, PLA and paramilitary troops play a very important role in the rescue action. Let's show our respect to them...












Where the people exist in, where the striving and conflict occur. So do the company I work in. 
When I went to company in the regular bus in the morning, I met a person A. I talk with him, so we know each other naturelly.
After the work, I went home by the regular bus in which I met A again. We start talking again. In this time, one of my familiar friends B came over and pass by. After a while, B call me loudly, and I came to him. As soon as I sat down, he asked me whether I known A before and how the relationship I was with A. Obviously I don't know A, so I said I am not familiar with A. B told me that A was his enemy and if I was B's good friend, the things would go worse, which will influence the friendship between B and me.
