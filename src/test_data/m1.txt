I disagree with the statement that newspapers and magazines are the best ways to learn about a foreign country.In the past, if we want to have a knowledge of a foreign country, newspapers and magazines may be only ways.They can supple lots of information about that country through pictures and characters, such as the pictures of views,discription of  local customs and  native cultures, and so on. However, with the development of science and technology, we can have access to abundant of information through a variety of different ways, and among them there are  some more effective ways.Television is very common in every family nowadays, which is a relatively  effective method. We can receive different kinds of programms about foreign countries on television, including the recommonds of travelling, food introduction, language studying and so on. Compared to newspapers and magazines, we can not only learn about foreign country through reading passages, we can also know about foreign country by watching  vedios and pictures, which are more lively than reading materials.Surfing the internet is another effective way to learn about foreign country. We can nearly get every information through internet, from the policy of that country to native cultures. We can even talk to a foreigner through MSN, which is a direct and effective way, and also it is more accurate. Besides, internet is more flexible than televison, for we can surf the internet at any time while television programms are boradcasted at certain times. And we can also watch TV programms through internet.
Finally, I think the most effective way to learn about foreicn country is learning just at that country. With the development of transportations, we can reach anywhere we would like to go in a short time.So it is feasible to travel to that country to learn about it.We can admire the views with our own eyes, listen to the local songs with our own ears, taste the food with our own tongues, and talk to native people.In a word, tavelling to the foreign country is actually the best way to learn about foreign country.
