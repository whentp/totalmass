I am pleased to write this recommendation letter in support Miss Ma Xiaomin, one of the outstanding students from our department, to your research program.

Three years ago I taught Miss. MA Xiaomin in the course of Prosthodontics when she was a senior. She studied diligently and ingeniously, and her inquisitiveness and independent thinking gave me deep impression. At the end of that semester, she got excellent record
in that course.

Then I have been more familiar with her since she became an intern in our department. She is always a hardworking girl, and has a passion to her work. Her knowledge of literature in her field is quite rich, and her clinical operating ability is as well as her brilliant intellectual ability.

When she designed her graduate project about ceramic material, she looked for several advices from me. I was impressed very much by her creativity and capability of analytical thinking. In her experiment, the standardization of test samples is hard to
control. At last, Miss Ma made a simple but effective device and managed to solve the problems by herself. So I am sure Miss. Ma has an excellent potential as a researcher.
Besides, her ability to speak, understand, read and write the English language is quite well. She had once done some interpretation of the book ¡°The Science and Art of
Porcelain Veneers¡± for our department, which is accurate and elegant, and I believe this will help her a lot in her research work.

Based on these qualities, I believe Miss Ma will achieve greater academic success in her future work. Therefore, I strongly support her application, and it would be greatly appreciated if you could give her your favorable consideration.
