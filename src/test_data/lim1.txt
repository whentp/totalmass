thanks to your interest. I understand from your c.v. that you are currently sutdying MDS in prosthodontics and will not graduate till 2011. Please visit our faculty web site for general information on the PhD and I shall ask our secretary to provide with the admission information.
 
Since our school will have a joint scientific meeting with your stomatology, I am sure that we can meet and you can understand a bit more of what we do before you finalise your decision of the topic for further research.
