 It's a miracle she survived after falling more than 50 feet from that window and that a paramedic just happened to be walking by moments later.

"Thirty-five years with EMS, this is actually the first time I came up by myself to see a baby on the ground. I never thought that I would see in this day and age a baby out a window," paramedic Willis Sands said.

Sands has saved countless lives over three decades, but seeing a 2-year-old baby girl on the pavement after a five-story fall brought the off duty EMT to tears.

"I thought it was a doll laying on the sidewalk. So I went over. Are you ok? I yelled for the mother. I saw there was blood," he said.
Sands screamed for someone - anyone to call 911 around 11:30 this morning because the baby wasn't breathing.

He used those crucial moments to turned the girl on her side and clear her airway.

As the infant started breathing and moaning, Sands and neighbor Marion Irizarry saw a man looking down from a Cruger Avenue apartment.

"Somebody on the fifth floor window. He said 'My daughter! My daughter!' And started yelling out, 'My daughter. Oh crap my daughter!' He was on a cell phone. That's all he kept saying," Irizarry said.

A neighbor, who didn't want to be identified, says the baby is a twin. She says she sometimes watches the children while their mother is working at a nearby nursing home.

Building superintendent Israel Caesano has only been on the job for three months. He doesn't know the family and couldn't explain why that window did not have a guard.

As he wiped away tears, he said this is a sad day.

It was not clear why the little girl fell from the window. The investigation was continuing.

The girl remained at Jacobi Medical Center in critical condition, being treated for head trauma.










A Brevard County man was located Monday after spending the night stranded on a lake.
Brett Johnson's boat was unable to move all night because of mechanical problems.
Johnson was able to make it back to the dock on Monday at Lake Washington Park in Melbourne.
The sheriff's office had boats and a helicopter looking for 50-year-old Johnson since he went missing on Sunday.
Johnson told WFTV that he had an oil line problem on Sunday after he took his small speed boat out for a spin around 5:00pm.
The small speed boat lost so much oil pressure, he said he could only motor into the closest land to camp out overnight.
Johnson said he was fine "camping out,¡± but it was his friends who were worried because Johnson left his cellphone, so no one knew where he was.
"I had my sleeping bag and my camping gear with me so I wasn't worried about it. I just camped out until this morning when the stores opened up,¡± said Johnson.
Johnson walked to the RaceTrac on US Highway 192 to get oil, which gave him enough power to motor back and he said he is thankful for all the people who came out to look for him.

 In the midst of Sunday morning storms, a falling tree landed on a tent at Lake Macbride State Park, killing a woman, who was alone in the tent.

Administrators at Cedar Rapids Kennedy High School confirm the woman killed was Jennifer Lewis, a chemistry teacher at the school. Principal Mary Wilcynski said on Sunday evening that Lewis had taught at Kennedy since 2009. She sent out an e-mail, addressed to school parents, early Sunday afternoon to inform them of Lewis¡¯s death.

Describing Lewis as a ¡°chemist by nature and a teacher by heart¡±, Wilcynski said counselors will be available for students and teachers.

¡°Just an outstanding young woman in the beginning of her career.¡±

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources said the victim was camping with friends and a sister on the park¡¯s south side campground. Investigators say the tree fell from ¡°adjacent private ground¡± onto the tent the victim was in.

In an e-mail to school parents, Wilcynski wrote that Lewis was a native of Washington, Iowa and graduated magna cum laude from Coe College in 2001. Wilcynski also stated Lewis worked in the chemical manufacturing industry before attending to the University of Kansas for her graduate degree in education.

This weekend started as one of celebration, with Cedar Rapids public schools holding graduating ceremonies throughout the past few days, including Kennedy¡¯s on Saturday night. Now Wilcynski said staff and students will close out the rest of the year, grieving together.

¡°Staff clearly grieve when a student is killed or harmed but, in this situation, not only students but staff as well and they can¡¯t be that support as much because they are grieving also.¡±















National Weather Service on Friday upgraded three recent tornadoes in Oklahoma to EF4, including the one that hit between Calumet and El Reno.
A horse ranch in Calumet took a direct hit from one of those EF4 tornadoes.
Ranch owner Brian Walling said out of their 21 horses at the ranch, only three survived. Among the surviving horses were Catori and her son, Moonstruck.
¡°She had him pinned up here. They were just snuggled up as tight up as they could," Walling said.
Walling and his wife said they took shelter in the cellar during the storm.
"I've lived here 14 years. (I've) accumulated a lot of things, and (in) 60 seconds, it was gone," Walling said.
The storm hit a scrap metal company across the street and leveled the ranch at the same time.
Walling said the light among all the devastation was that Catori and Moonstruck survived.
"They survived a tornado, out in the elements of the tornado and not in shelter. They were in it," Walling said.
Catori and Moonstruck suffered minor scrapes and bruises and are expected to make a full recovery.














"It's a big mess. We're trying to clean it up," Diaz said. "We're going to sell cans to get money to get stuff."
Silvia Mitchell, of Bloomington, was watching TV and was moved by Diaz. She contacted 6News for help to find the family.
"That little boy grabbed my heart the second I saw him on TV, and I couldn't get him off my mind," Mitchell said. "I had to do something."
Mitchell went to Greensburg to help get Diaz and his family back on their feet.
"I thought it was a miracle that somebody would help us," Diaz said. "It means a lot to my family and me."
The last few days haven't been easy.
"We're pretty sad. Right now, we're trying to get all the stuff out of our old trailer and move it into my uncle's shed," Diaz said.
But the family's future is a bit brighter now because of the kindness of a stranger.
"We need to help each other. They went through something horrible, and I'm glad I could do something," Mitchell said.
Mitchell's daughter, Deanna Kobbe, lives in Greensburg and is working on a way to keep support coming to Diaz and his family.
"I can't fathom an 11-year-old boy having to try to find a means to help his family," Kobbe said.
"They're a beautiful family, and I just wish them the best," Mitchell said.
6News didn't ask Mitchell for the amount of her donation. She said it wasn't much, but she wanted to give what she could.
A $10 donation for storm victims can be made to the American Red Cross by texting Red Cross to 90999.









A Fuquay-Varina mother is working to make life easier for the families of soldiers who serve their country.

"You don't have to wear a uniform to be part of this amazing freedom that we fight for," said Bianca Strzalkowski, 31, who is married to active-duty Marine Corps gunnery Sgt. Ronald Strzalkowski.

Along with supporting her husband and three children, Bianca Strzalkowski has worked to help other military families.

As the only volunteer with the Raleigh recruiting station's family readiness program, she created a meals program for new moms across the state and training to help spouses understand the lifestyle of military recruiters.

Military Spouse magazine recently selected her from among hundreds of nominees as the 2011 Military Spouse of the Year. She got to meet First Lady Michelle Obama and have dinner with the head of the Marine Corps.

"It was shocked. It was by far one of the greatest moments of my life," Bianca Strzalkowski said.



Her husband, mother and a fellow military spouse nominated her for the honor.

"I appreciate that I work for an organization that prides itself in being able to recognize those who aren't doing the actual job but are supporting the one who is doing the job," Ronald Strzalkowski said.

Bianca Strzalkowoski said she wants to use her title to get civilians more involved with helping troops. A full-time college student, she wants to help expand educational and career opportunities for military spouses.

She said Sen. Kay Hagan has reached out to her to learn more about the challenges faced by military spouses and how they can be helped.

For now, the Strzalkowski family is enjoying time together ahead of a possible deployment to Iraq.











 A Bartlett student's middle school speech is on its way to going viral. The 14 year old was co-valedictorian of her middle school class. She was assigned to write and deliver a speech at the 8th graduation and she's now inspiring people all over the internet.

14 year old Olivia Halvorson is talented and smart. News Channel 3 catches up with her at her Frayser church playing piano. Her family and friends always knew she would achieve great things but they didn't know her inspiration until Olivia, co-valedictorian of her Appling Middle School class, wrote a speech for her 8th grade graduation.

"Everyday I'm inspired by what this 11 year old boy achieves. He can read. He can write. He plays sports. He has friends. He has people who love him and every person he meets is inspired by him too," Olivia said in her speech.

The boy Olivia is talking about is her 11 year old brother, Ben. He takes on many of life's challenges even though he has Down Syndrome. With each task he takes on, he most work harder than most.

Olivia told the crowd, "If it wasn't for Ben, I might not be up here right now. I wouldn't have struggled as much to set a good example for him to follow but I don't lose an ounce of sleep wondering what my life would have been like if it wasn't for that one extra chromosome."















Mid-State resident Tom Caroland enlisted in the United States Army in 1949 at the age of 18.  Monday he will celebrate his 80th birthday.

Caroland told Nashville's News 2, "I had just turned 18 and I said, 'Well, I need to do my part and serve my country.'"

After enlisting, Caroland was soon shipped off to fight in the Korean War in September of 1950.  He was captured just three months later, on December 13, 1950.

Letters and telegrams were the only form of communication for Caroland's family.

A telegram informing his parents of Caroland's capture, reads, in part, "Your Son, Caroland, Thomas, Jr. has been missing in action."

Three long years later, his family received the telegram they'd been waiting for: A note from Tom saying he was coming home.

"They finally got the word in August of 1953," Caroland recalled.

Two weeks later, he arrived home to Springfield.  He was a local hero and a sign of hope for the Robertson County community.

"I was the only POW to get back alive in Robertson County at that time," he said.

Caroland believes all Americans should take time to recognize the cost of freedom.

"I think we need to emphasize it a lot more than just one day," he said, adding, "Like they say, freedom is not cheap."

This Memorial Day is a special one for Caroland, who turns 80 on Monday.

It's a fitting holiday and birthday for an American hero.

"I would do it again," he said. "I would go back again to serve my country."













One resident told 10News the flock gathered on Journey Street, where Chula Vista police surrounded them. However, the flock then made their way to a nearby cul-de-sac where they rested on the roadway.
A Chula Vista Animal Control officer was able to corral them into a resident's backyard where they waited for some experts from Escondido to take them away.
The sheep were taken to Jamul by the San Diego Humane Society where they will be housed until their owner claims them.
This is not the first time farm animals roamed the streets Chula Vista. Last year, in the same neighborhood about 10 horses ran wild through the streets until they were corralled by Chula Vista police and Border Patrol agents.









The city held a community meeting Sunday afternoon as the rain began to fall again. Hundreds of residents attended the meeting, looking for answers and updates from city and county officials. Residents had two major concerns: roads and water.
"The biggest concern is when do they expect the water to recede," said Roundup resident John Perrella.
Flood waters have forced roads to close, stranding Roundup residents, who are also facing the possibility of running out of drinking water.
"I wanted information as far as roads and the water situation obviously, because even though we're out of the city, we're on city water," said Sandy Davis, who lives just outside of Roundup.
The city has been working to fix the pumps that supply the city's water, and officials said they expect the pumps to be up and running by Tuesday. Officials are also trying to do all they can to prepare for another wave of flooding.
"We're trying to shore up anything that we can for the next surge of water we know we're going to get. And it's not just from the rain that's coming. It's from the warmer temperatures and the large snowpack we have," said Musselshell County Disaster and Emergency Services coordinator Jeff Gates.
But Roundup residents were still able to find the silver lining to the rain clouds that just won't clear.
"Well, basically it's bringing the community together. There's a lot of communication errors here and there, but it's pulling people together and showing you what real people are like," Perrella said.
Officials asked residents to conserve water as the city only had a two to three day supply left as of Sunday afternoon. They say some well water may also have been contaminated and recommended people to boil the water before consuming it.
Gates said waters in Roundup have receded by nearly two feet, but the Musselshell River is expected to crest again as the new storm system moves in.













 Firefighters from the Gig Harbor Fire Department returned from New York on Monday with a piece of steel from the World Trade Center.
The team of four Gig Harbor Firefighters, Kent Cooper, Rob McCoy, Josh Bissenas, and Ryan Watson, picked up the World Trade Center artifact on Wednesday at Hanger 17 at JFK Airport.
On Thursday, they visited Ground Zero, received a tour of New York Harbor on the "Firefighter", and attended the commissioning ceremony for FDNY's newest fire boat "Bravest," which was built in Port Orchard.
The artifact from the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks in New York City was awarded to Gig Harbor Fire and Medic One. It was the second piece of steel to be awarded to an agency in Washington.
The steel, identified as ¡°Piece H-0028c¡± weighs 986 pounds and is five feet long, Gig Harbor Assistant Chief Eric Watson said.
The agency plans to incorporate the steel into a memorial garden that will honor and remember the victims and emergency services workers who were killed in the terrorist attacks. The garden will be located in a public area of one of Gig Harbor Fire's facilities.
Four Gig Harbor firefighters drove a fire district pickup truck to New York City and back to retrieve the artifact. They took personal time off, and funded the trip with donations and their own money.












 The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan says two Latino residents were illegally arrested, even though they provided their ID's.  

The ACLU says that in February, Telma Valdez, who has lived in the United States for almost 22 years, and her son, Luis Valdez, a college student at Grand Rapids Community College who was born in the U.S., were stopped by an unidentified Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officer.  The report says the agent held a gun up, and demanded them to show identification.  Both Luis and Telma, according to the ACLU, gave the agent their driver¡¯s licenses, yet the agent still reportedly demanded them to get out of the car.

The ACLU reports that Telma was handcuffed and placed in the agent¡¯s car, while he held a gun to her back and banged her head into the car.  Luis was handcuffed as well, and both were taken to an apartment.

Throughout this ordeal, the report says that Luis repeatedly tried to explain that he was a U.S. citizen, and that his mother had a green card with her.  Soon after the card was retrieved, the agents reportedly realized they had arrested legal citizens, and the two were released.

However, the ACLU says the agent told Telma that, ¡°she risked losing her legal status if she told her story to anyone.¡±

The ACLU has sent in a FOIA request, asking ICE to hand over all records of the event. You can read their full report by clicking here.

The organization says, ¡°fairness and equality are the most fundamental values we share as Americans. There's nothing fair or equal about arresting citizens because of the color of their skin. We are deeply concerned that this mother and son were victims of racial profiling. It¡¯s imperative that we understand what led to this abuse of power and what policies are in place to protect Michigan residents.¡±













 This year¡¯s Indianapolis 500 is in the history books, and a day later, a different kind of race took place on the track; a race to clean it up.

Organizations are cashing in by giving up their Memorial Day to clean up the tons of trash race fans left behind.

24-Hour News 8 caught up with a group from Mooresville High School cleaning the section of the grandstand that overlooks the yard of bricks.

All together, 40 volunteers from the school¡¯s soccer team, players, parents, coaches and their friends are working to sweep, shovel and bag the mountains of trash.

They started at 7 a.m. and still had work ahead of them at noon.

¡°It¡¯s a lot of work. I never imagined there was this much garbage. It¡¯s heavy too,¡± said Tammy Walters. She says the strategy is to sweep it to the aisles, shovel it up and go.

It¡¯s not the most pleasant work. Tammy says among the beer cans and scraps of food she¡¯s seen a flip flop, a hat and numerous uneaten sandwich.

With Monday¡¯s heat, the cleanup crews are certainly working up a sweat. Equity is what they get in return.

The group from Mooresville High School says they¡¯ll earn more than $4,000 for the soccer team. 










Politicians are in plentiful supply this Memorial Day as the ramp-up to the 2012 presidential election begins in earnest.
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who began a nationwide bus tour Sunday, generated plenty of buzz, visiting Fort McHenry in Baltimore and Mount Vernon in Virginia on Monday.
She told CNN on Monday that she plans to take her "One Nation" bus tour to Iowa, the state that votes first in the race for the Republican presidential nomination.
"I'm sure at some point I will be going to Iowa," Palin said.
The 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee told reporters earlier on Monday she is "still kind of contemplating" a White House run.
Soldiers pay respects at Arlington Student puts Arlington graves online Palin in 2012: Will she or won't she? Will Bachmann throw hat into ring?

"I think any Republican candidate is very, very electable," she said. "I think Americans are ready for true change."
Palin's Memorial Day schedule was also expected to take her to the battlefield at Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. As of 5 p.m. ET she hadn't arrived yet, but more than 100 people were waiting, some for hours.
Over the next few days, Palin's "One Nation" bus tour is also scheduled to make stops at historic sites in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, the latter home to the nation's first primary.
"This isn't a campaign bus," she said. "This is a bus to be able to express to America how much we appreciate our foundation, and to invite more people to be interested in all that is good about America."
"We don't need to fundamentally transform America," she added. "We need to restore what's good about America."
Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, who would compete with Palin for Tea Party support should she run, was attending Memorial Day events in New Hampshire.
She has already hired staff in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina -- all key states that hold early caucuses or primaries.
Bachmann has promised to make a presidential announcement during June in Waterloo, Iowa, the town where she was born.
Former Minnesota Gov. and Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty, who announced his candidacy last week, was spending the day in Iowa, including a stop at a pancake breakfast in Waukee.
Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who is expected to announce his presidential bid on Thursday in New Hampshire, did not share his Memorial Day plans. He did release a statement, however, praising both veterans and current military service members.
"As we observe Memorial Day, we owe thanks to the many Americans who have fought and died to defend our country," Romney said. "Those patriots who are on the battlefields today or have gone to battlefields in the past, some never to return, have left us a stronger country, a great nation that, whatever its divisions, shines as a beacon of liberty before the peoples of the world."











President Barack Obama led the nation's Memorial Day observances Monday, laying a wreath at Arlington National Cemetery's Tomb of the Unknowns and declaring that Americans owe "a debt to our fallen heroes that we can never fully repay."
"The blessings we enjoy as Americans came at a dear cost," Obama told a crowd at the cemetery's Memorial Amphitheater. "To those of you who mourn the loss of a loved one today, my heart goes out to you. ... This day is about you. And the fallen heroes that you loved."
Obama names new head of Joint Chiefs
Military servicemen and women killed while serving their country "gave of themselves until they had nothing more to give," he said. "It is their courage, their unselfishness, their devotion to duty that has sustained this country through all its trials and will sustain us through all the trials to come."
We need to hold "their memories close to our hearts and (heed) the example they set," he said.

Hundreds of people trying to enjoy the Memorial Day weekend on Atlantic beaches in central Florida encountered an unwelcome surprise: swarms of purplish, stinging jellyfish.
More than 800 people at beaches from Cocoa Beach to Cape Canaveral have been stung, Brevard County Ocean Rescue officials said.
Assistant Chief Eisen Witcher said the reports began coming in Friday, but as the Memorial Day weekend got into full swing, the numbers increased dramatically.
"Saturday, we got about 200 reports. Sunday, we got another 250," he said.
All weekend long, countless numbers of jellyfish washed up on shores, standing out against the sand due to their distinctive hue.
"They're very visible because of their color," Witcher said. "They come in large amounts, very large groups."
Witcher said Brevard County shores are more familiar with Portuguese man o' war and cannonball jellyfish, not this current species, which he said he believes are called mauve stingers.
"This time of year, this can happen when the conditions are perfect for jellyfish to wash up. You have an onshore breeze combined with an east swell."
The stings cause itching, burning and rashes and can sometimes spur an allergic reaction.
Although none of the stings was believed to be serious, officials said two people who were stung were taken to hospitals after suffering from respiratory distress. It was unclear whether the distress was directly caused by the sting or came from a pre-existing medical condition.
"Most of the stings are being reported on the ankles, but others have been getting it on the chest, arms, you name it," Witcher said.
He said victims were being treated by a vinegar solution stocked at the various lifeguard stations.
"We have that solution there at all times, but we knew that we were going to have a lot of people out here this weekend," Witcher said. "These jellyfish are not a major threat, but they are annoying."











Emergency crews freed an injured caver Monday who fell during a difficult expedition through a remote Franklin County, Tennessee, cave, a county spokesman said.
The nature of the man's injuries was unclear, according to county spokesman Chris Guess, who said the victim would be transferred to Erlanger Hospital in Chattanooga for treatment.
The man fell Sunday afternoon on the seventh of eight vertical descents, or drops, inside the Sinking Cove Cave in southern Tennessee, not far from the Tennessee-Alabama border, according to Brian Krebs with the Southeastern Cave Conservancy. The group holds the lease on the cave.
The expedition being attempted by the man, who is an experienced caver according to Krebs, would rate about a 9.5 on a difficulty scale of 10, he said.
Before the rescue, Krebs said extracting the injured man from the cave would be a challenge. Not only did he have to be lifted through the seven drops, but the man had to pass through a small crawl space that is about eight inches high and 14 inches wide, Krebs said.
Rescue workers made that crawl space bigger so they could get him out, according to Guess.
The rescue was complicated by the lack of cell service and the remote location. Krebs said the site is "about as far back in the wilderness as you can go."














Tom Watson is one of the greatest golfers who ever lived. That¡¯s a given. He won eight major championships ¡ª only five legendary golfers (Nicklaus, Woods, Hagen, Hogan, Player) have won more. He won 39 PGA events, which ties him with a couple of guys named Sarazen and Mickelson for 10th. He beat Nicklaus head-to-head three times ¡ª at Augusta, at Turnberry, at Pebble Beach ¡ª in three of the most famous duels in the history of golf. On Sunday, at age 61, he won the Senior PGA Championship in Louisville. That was his sixth major title on the Senior Tour (or ¡°Champions Tour¡± as they beg people to call it) ¡ª only Nicklaus and Hale Irwin have won more. I¡¯m not saying anything here that you don¡¯t know. Tom Watson is certainly and unquestionably one of the greatest golfers who ever lived.

And yet ¡­ I think Watson¡¯s career is singular because unlike any of the other great golfers, Watson¡¯s life is really divided in two. There was the young and wild Watson who hit the ball all over the place and won with one of the great short games in golf history. And there is the older Watson, whose ball-striking is so magnificent that men half his age salivate, but who has been held back by 5-foot putts that stubbornly go their own way.

If the game of the old and young Watson had ever met, they would not recognize each other.

If the old Watson and the young Watson had ever shared a season, they might have won the Grand Slam.


They did not. Watson won the last of his six PGA Tour Player of the Year awards in 1984. He found what he calls ¡°The Secret¡± in 1994. In the nine years between, he suffered. The young Watson was stormy and miraculous ¡ª even HE used the phrase ¡°Watson Par¡± to describe his hit-into-the-trees, hack-it-somewhere-near-the-green, somehow-get-it-to-10-feet, drain-the-putt style. He would say it with a hint of mischief in his voice ¡ª ¡°There you go, another Watson par¡± ¡ª but he did it too often for anyone to think of it as luck. In those days, Watson was the boldest putter in the world. And this was because he was fearless. He knew that if he hit it 4- or 6-feet by, he would make the comeback. He KNEW it.

When he stopped making those 4- or 6-footers, well, suddenly the well of Watson Pars dried up. Those suddenly turned into Watson Bogeys. He had a two-year spell when he didn¡¯t win a single tournament. And then, after he won the Nabisco in 1987, he did not win for the next eight years. You have to understand that for Tom Watson, winning is the reason to play golf. He is driven by competition, by proving himself, by being on top of the leaderboard and then bringing the championship home. ¡°I don¡¯t like golf on sunny days,¡± he has told me many times ¡ª the game of golf is not an escape for him like it is for millions of Americans. It is not relaxing. It is not social. It is about being the best, and when he wasn¡¯t winning, the game was misery.

Then in 1994, suddenly, absurdly, he found The Secret. You can read his book The Timeless Swing if you want details, and if you are a golfer I recommend it highly. The Secret changed his game entirely. And, like that, his swing was crisp and refined. He was hitting the ball exactly where he wanted to hit it. He was hearing that sound, the sound of purity, just about every single time he swung the club. The other golfers marveled ¡ª he could do anything with the ball. Suddenly (and really for the first time) people started talking about Watson¡¯s ball-striking. Watson won Nicklaus¡¯ tournament, the Memorial, when he was 46 years old. He won at Colonial when he was 48, and came close to winning at Pebble Beach that same year.

The old Watson missed a lot of putts. A ¡­ lot ¡­ of ¡­ putts. People sent him tips and aids and putters ¡ª at one point the walls in his office in Kansas were lined with putters people sent. If he could have putted once he started hitting the ball pure ¡ª he really could have been something. Then again, if he could have hit the ball pure back when he was making every putt ¡ª he really could have been something.

And then again ¡­ he really WAS something anyway.

Like I say, I don¡¯t think there¡¯s another career quite like it. Even Watson has said, with only a touch of wistfulness, ¡°I sure wish I could have hit the ball then like I do now,¡± and ¡°I sure wish I could putt now like did then.¡± But, more than wistfulness, he feels joy because he¡¯s had two distinct lives in golf. ¡°Golf defines me,¡± he says.

It was so much fun to watch Watson win again on Sunday. Everyone who likes golf even a little bit will remember two years ago, at Turnberry, when a 59-year-old Tom Watson was one putt away from winning the British Open. He missed that putt, of course ¡ª or as Nicklaus famously said: ¡°You hit that putt the way all the rest of us would have hit it.¡± I think if he had won the British Open it would have been the biggest golf story ever. I think it would have been one of the biggest sports stories ever. I think he probably would have been SI¡¯s Sportsman of the Year. As it was, the story was amazing. I mean, we all still remember Jack Nicklaus summoning his youth and winning the Masters in 1986. Watson was THIRTEEN YEARS OLDER than Nicklaus when he almost won the British Open. Finishing second was inspiring.

Only Watson did not see it that way. He could not see it that way ¡ª that just isn¡¯t the way his mind works. He plays to win. And he did not win. And that was the story in his mind. Yes, he was touched by the many letters he received. He was overwhelmed by the stories he heard from people who talked about how much his performance had affected them. But, in the end, he could not see it as anything but a missed opportunity. He could have won. Hell, he should have won. And he did not win. And while deep in his heart he has to know it¡¯s different, he still put that 2009 British Open on the pile of all the tournaments that he let get away.

¡°It¡¯s about the wins,¡± he told me then and many other times before and after. He means it. I¡¯ve told this story before, but it¡¯s worth repeating: Tom and I both sponsored teams in the RBI Program (Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities). And one day a few years back I casually mentioned to him that our teams of sixth graders would be playing each other. And without hesitation, without warning, his face suddenly went dark, and he glared hard at me, and he said: ¡°We¡¯ll kick your a¨C.¡± He was not joking. He meant it.

And so I watched him closely on those final few holes in Louisville on Sunday. He was trying to become the oldest golfer to win the Senior PGA since 1947, which is only interesting because I had no idea they HAD a Senior PGA in 1947. In any case, I thought I could tell even through the television how badly he wanted this one. For one thing: He was smiling a lot, and the Watson smile can be deceiving. The smile does not necessarily mean he¡¯s happy. The smile sometimes covers up the hunger. He was smiling like that before he announced that his sixth grade team would kick the a¨C of my sixth grade team. He smiled a lot after the heartbreak of Turnberry.

Watson made some big putts on Sunday. He would say that there were a couple of putts on the back nine that made the difference, and then, in perfect Watson form, he changed it to say that there actually were THREE putts that made the difference. Tom is nothing if not precise. He could have won the tournament on 17, when his putt stopped 1/10 of an inch short. He could have won the tournament on 18, when he pushed his final putt. He did win the tournament on the first playoff hole, when he made sand-save birdie, the last 3-foot-putt dead center.

What does it mean? You could make the argument ¡ª with Watson nearly winning the British Open at 59, and winning a Senior PGA at 61 ¡ª that he is the greatest old golfer in the history of the game. The argument would, of course, include Nicklaus and Irwin and Sam Snead (the oldest to win on the PGA Tour) and a few others. The argument also probably wouldn¡¯t interest too many people, Watson least of all.

Watson beat a man named David Eger, who played an inspired tournament. And I mean this kindly: I had never heard of him before Sunday. I mean it kindly because Eger, after a forgettable PGA Tour career (one Top 10 finish), reinvented himself as an older golfer and has won four times on the Senior Tour. That makes him a great story.

And that¡¯s how golf stories usually go. Most brilliant young golfers lose their games when they are young. And some struggling young golfers find their form in their later years. Only one golfer, as far as I know, did both.















The phrase "pure shooter" has always struck me as slightly damning, suggesting a player who can whip anyone's butt in H-O-R-S-E might not be a complete player, and, further, might not be the guy you want to have the ball in crunch time. A pure shooter needs space and time, and you usually don't get much of either in the Finals, where, by Game 3, defenses not only have their opponent's play calls down but also most variations of them.
Therefore, I would never refer to Dirk Nowitzki as a "pure shooter," which is something that has been bandied about over the last six weeks of the Dallas Mavericks forward's remarkably productive postseason. His teammate, Jason Terry, is closer to being a pure shooter than Nowitzki since Terry's role is pretty much defined as coming into the game and purely shooting ... along with a generous output of self-celebration.
In fact, I use the term "pure shooter" very carefully. Ray Allen's shot is surely pure, but the Boston Celtics veteran will also get you a tough rebound, play hard-nosed defense and give up the ball when someone else should get it. Of modern players, I suppose that Orlando's J.J. Redick might accurately be called a pure shooter. In the past, several other names come to mind, such as Dale Ellis, Glen Rice and Dell Curry. Was Mark Price a pure shooter? Well, he had a sweet stroke but he was also a playmaker who averaged double figures in assists one season, so I hesitate to define him as such. I suppose that Craig Hodges, John Paxson and Steve Kerr all qualify as pure shooters, but what other role could they play on a team with Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen, where there was almost always space and time.
With the possible exception of Allen, Nowitzki towers above all the previously mentioned players. And as he prepares to do battle with the Miami Heat (and, apparently, the linebacker defense of LeBron James, who has volunteered to check the seven-foot German), Nowitzki must be branded as a shooter, someone with an extra dimension or two to his game that a pure shooter doesn't have.
Larry Bird, for example, was a shooter, too, something I mention because the Bird-Nowitzki comparison has become obligatory, sitting there all bright and shiny, ready to be supported or debunked. Consider me a debunker. Bird was, first and most obviously, one of the greatest passers of all-time, perhaps the best ever at the one-touch re-direct whereby he found an open teammate so quickly that the teammate didn't even know he was open. Nowitzki is only an average passer. Bird was also a much better rebounder than Nowitzki, a much better defender (not a lockdown guy but a gifted passing-lane thief) and, needless to say, a much better clutch player since he was mostly terrific in five NBA Finals, three of which his Celtics won. Dirk has had only one previous attempt at a ring and shot just 39 percent from the field in the Mavs' six-game loss to the Heat in 2006 Finals.
But since Bird and Nowitzki are both outstanding perimeter players made extraordinary by their size, and they are both Caucasian with pasty complexions ... well, there you are.
At any rate, Nowitzki has all the characteristics that great shooters must have. To wit:
1. Accuracy.
Could it get any more obvious? Shooters are not good because of volume, they are good because they make shots. Nowitzki is a .476 lifetime shooter (Bird finished his career at .496 in the obligatory-mention department) and Dirk has made almost 52 percent of his shots in this notable postseason.
2. Ability to get open, work for shots and make them with defenders in your face.
Whereas pure shooters get to spots and earn their pay with open looks, great shooters draw so much attention that they have to move, catch on the move and then shoot in traffic. Nowitzki is at a distinct advantage since his height enables him to post up almost every defender in the league (usually just north of the free-throw line), and he's not a catch-me-if-you-can jitterbug around screens as was, say, Reggie Miller.
But so what? Dirk catches it in congestion and does something with it, backing down his defender (in the obligatory-mention department, he resembles Bird in this respect) and releasing a shot that is virtually unblockable.
3. Three-point range.
Any shooter has to take it deep to be truly dangerous. Nowitzki is hitting an absurd percentage (.516) of his threes in this postseason and his .381 lifetime mark is terrific, better even than the .376 posted by you-know-who in the obligatory-mention department.
4. Knock down the freebies.
There's no use being a great shooter if the defense will put you on the line late in the game. Nobody wants to foul Nowitzki, a career .877 shooter from the line who, going into the Miami series, has nice round-number stats for this postseason -- he has made 130 of 140 for a percentage of .929. In other words, Miami, do not foul this guy. (Obligatory mention: Bird was a .886 career free-throw shooter and never seemed to miss when it mattered.)
5. Shooting form must hold up throughout the game.
Just as a golfer has a better chance of succeeding on the 72nd hole of a tournament if his swing is grooved, so does a shooter increase his chances of thriving when his technique is consistent. Nowitzki looks like he's going to make everything every time, the squared-up body, the perfect alignment between elbow and wrist, the high release. (Obligatory mention: Bird's shot always looked good, too, but not as good as Dirk's.)
6. Do it on the biggest stage.
This is what Nowitzki still has to prove, obviously, unlike the obligatory-mention guy who did it time after time. If Nowitzki was nothing more than a pure shooter, I wouldn't give Dallas a chance against Miami, but he has taken his game to a different level in this postseason and shown the ability to win games almost by himself.
In the end, though, I see the Heat prevailing over the Mavs. Nowitzki will have a productive Finals, even with LeBron heavy-breathing all over him, but it won't be enough. And if that turns out to be true, don't consider the Mavs' defeat purely the fault of this guy, who is so much more than a pure shooter.











The character traits that have made Jim Tressel a successful football coach and a beloved figure in Ohio are numerous and frequently cited. Former NFL coach Tony Dungy has praised Tressel's "integrity" and said he is the kind of man you'd want your son to play for. Eddie DeBartolo, the former 49ers owner, has said that Tressel's "steady" demeanor and knack for relating to young men reminded him of Hall of Fame coach Bill Walsh.
Tressel has often been described as senatorial, an adjective rarely applied to a football coach; in fact, one of his nicknames is the Senator. He has been lauded for his sincerity and his politeness, and people who admire his faith in God often mention the prayer-request box on the desk in his office at Ohio State.
The 58-year-old Tressel benefited from the fertile recruiting grounds of Ohio, but supporters always believed he got the most out of players because he was -- as the title of a 2009 book about him declares -- More Than a Coach. Under Tressel, the Buckeyes often sat together before meetings or at the start of practice for 10 minutes of "quiet time" to read about virtues such as humility, faith and gratitude. Tressel liked to say that his teams "play as hard as we can play" but also "respect as hard as we can respect."
Yet while Tressel's admirable qualities have been trumpeted, something else essential to his success has gone largely undiscussed: his ignorance. Professing a lack of awareness isn't usually the way to get ahead, but it has helped Tressel at key moments in his career. As coach at Youngstown (Ohio) State in the mid-1990s, he claimed not to know that his star quarterback had received a car and more than $10,000 from a school trustee and his associates -- even though it was later established in court documents that Tressel had told the player to go see the trustee. In 2003, during Tressel's third season in Columbus, Buckeyes running back Maurice Clarett was found to have received money and other benefits. Even though Tressel said he spent more time with Clarett than with any other player, he also said he did not know that Clarett had been violating the rules. A year later an internal Ohio State investigation (later corroborated by the NCAA) found that quarterback Troy Smith had taken $500 from a booster. It was the second time the booster had been investigated for allegedly providing improper benefits to a star player, but again Tressel said he had no knowledge of the illicit payment.
On Monday -- after months of turmoil during which he had first claimed to be unaware of violations in his program and then acknowledged that he had known about them -- Tressel resigned. (He had four years left on his estimated $3.5 million-a-year contract.) In his 10 seasons Tressel was the most successful coach in Columbus since Woody Hayes, having led the Buckeyes to three BCS title games, the 2002 national championship, a 9-1 record against Michigan and a winning percentage of 82.8%. But like Hayes, who was fired after hitting a Clemson player during the 1978 Gator Bowl, Tressel exits ignominiously, all of his many accomplishments tarnished. "After meeting with university officials, we agreed that it is in the best interest of Ohio State that I resign as head football coach," Tressel said in a statement. "The appreciation that [my wife] Ellen and I have for the Buckeye Nation is immeasurable." The school named Luke Fickell, 37, as interim coach for the 2011 season. The team's co-defensive coordinator and assistant head coach, Fickell is a Columbus native who played for Ohio State from 1992 to '96.
Tressel's most recent troubles began in December, when the Department of Justice, passing along information it had gathered in a raid while investigating the owner of a Columbus tattoo parlor for drug trafficking, informed Ohio State that at least six current players, -including quarterback Terrelle Pryor, had traded team memorabilia for tattoos or cash at the parlor. When those revelations became public, Tressel said he hadn't known what the players had done and expressed disappointment that they had not listened to what he called the "little sensor" inside them that knew right from wrong. Four of Tressel's highest-profile players were found to have committed major NCAA violations, yet the coach's supporters insisted that those were isolated incidents outside his control.
Then, on March 8, Tressel stood before TV cameras and confirmed a Yahoo report that he had been aware of the memorabilia-for-ink scandal and had not informed Ohio State officials when asked about it in December. Tressel said he had first learned that players were breaking NCAA rules almost a year earlier, in April 2010, when a Columbus lawyer e-mailed him. Rather than alert his superiors, as NCAA regulations require, Tressel said he "couldn't think" whom to tell. It was later reported that he had told one person, a hometown adviser of Pryor's. By ignoring his own "little sensor" and failing to be forthcoming, Tressel protected key players from being ruled ineligible for much of the 2010 season, in which the Buckeyes were a popular pick to reach the BCS championship game. (They ended up going 12-1.)
A failure to disclose potential violations is considered one of the NCAA's cardinal sins and almost always leads to a coach's dismissal or resignation. Yet Ohio State supported Tressel and continued backing him despite weeks of negative press and calls by prominent alumni for him to be replaced.
That support crumbled suddenly over Memorial Day weekend. Tressel was forced out three days after Sports Illustrated alerted Ohio State officials that the wrongdoing by Tressel's players was far more widespread than had been reported. SI learned that the memorabilia-for-tattoos violations actually stretched back to 2002, Tressel's second season at Ohio State, and involved at least 28 players -- 22 more than the university has acknowledged. Those numbers include, beyond the six suspended players, an additional nine current players as well as nine former players whose alleged wrongdoing might fall within the NCAA's four-year statute of limitations on violations.
One former Buckeye, defensive end Robert Rose, whose career ended in 2009, told SI that he had swapped memorabilia for tattoos and that "at least 20 others" on the team had done so as well. SI's investigation also uncovered allegations that Ohio State players had traded memorabilia for marijuana and that Tressel had potentially broken NCAA rules when he was a Buckeyes assistant coach in the mid-1980s.
Last Friday, SI informed Ohio State spokesman Jim Lynch of the new allegations and asked that Tressel be made aware of them. Lynch said the school would have some comment by the end of the day. No comment came, and on Saturday, Lynch told SI to contact Tressel's lawyer, Gene Marsh, for any response from the coach; Lynch also said he could not confirm that Tressel had been apprised of the new allegations. The implication was clear: Ohio State was distancing itself from Tressel. (E-mails from SI to Tressel and to Marsh and multiple phone messages for Marsh went unanswered.)
For more than a decade, Ohioans have viewed Tressel as a pillar of rectitude, and have disregarded or made excuses for the allegations and scandal that have quietly followed him throughout his career. His integrity was one of the great myths of college football. Like a disgraced politician who preaches probity but is caught in lies, the Senator was not the person he purported to be.










To understand the arc of Tressel's head-coaching career, start with its blue-collar origin in the Steel Valley. Youngstown State hired Tressel in December 1985. He had grown up mostly in Berea, about 90 minutes west, as part of a noted Ohio football family. Jim's father, Lee, coached at Baldwin-Wallace in Berea for 23 seasons -- Jim played quarterback for him from 1971 through '74 -- and in 1978 led the college to the Division III national championship.
Since the late 1970s, Youngstown had hemorrhaged steel-industry jobs. The more its longtime source of pride slipped away, the more important the Youngstown State football program became. Tressel's decorous manner and his appeal to area blue-chippers were just what the town craved. His first team finished 2-9, but the next one went 8-4 and won the Ohio Valley Conference. In 1990, with hometown hero Ray Isaac under center, the Penguins went undefeated in the regular season. In '91 they won the Division I-AA national title.
"The community took great pride in that team," says Leslie -Cochran, who became the university's president in 1992. It took equal pride in Tressel. He wore his Christian values on his sweater vest and founded a chapter of the Fellowship of Christian Athletes. Tressel was especially skilled at taking troubled kids and molding them into a team. "A lot of [players] came from broken homes," Cochran says. "They'd see [Tressel] as a fatherly model."
But there was a seamy underside to the Penguins' success. In 1988, according to court documents from a jury-tampering trial involving Mickey Monus, a wealthy school trustee and the founder of the Phar-Mor chain of drug stores, Tressel had called Monus about arranging a job for Isaac. The player and the CEO had never met, but Isaac told SI that he had heard of Monus's "philanthropist-type hand" from two basketball players. At his first meeting with Monus, Isaac received $150. According to the court documents, by the time he left Youngstown State, in 1992, Isaac had collected more than $10,000 in cash and checks from Monus and Monus's associates and employees.
In January 1994 the NCAA's director of enforcement sent Cochran an ominous letter. It said that according to an anonymous source, Isaac had been driving a car provided by a local business, which would turn out to be Phar-Mor; 13 Penguins had had jobs with Phar-Mor during the season, in violation of NCAA rules; and nonscholarship student athletes were being illegally paid by the university's director of athletic development.
Over the next month Cochran quizzed football staff members in informal meetings. He believed that if anybody was aware of what was going on in the program, it was Tressel. But Tressel told Cochran that the tipster was just a disgruntled former employee. Given Tressel's sterling reputation, Cochran felt confident relaying a nothing-to-see-here message to the NCAA.
In 1995, Monus was convicted in federal court of 109 felony counts of bank, wire and mail fraud, conspiracy, obstruction of justice and interstate transportation of stolen goods related to his looting of Phar-Mor's corporate coffers. Three years later Monus was on trial for jury tampering in the government's first prosecution of him, which had ended in a hung jury. During this trial (at which Monus was found not guilty) Monus and Isaac, who had pleaded guilty to attempting to bribe a juror on -Monus's behalf, disclosed their financial dealings while Isaac was a student and alleged that Tressel had set these in motion with that first phone call.
A -reporter covering the jury-tampering trial called the school and reported Monus's and Isaac's testimony, prompting an internal investigation. That probe revealed that Isaac's car was the worst-kept secret on campus. According to NCAA documents, all of Isaac's teammates who were interviewed "except one" knew about the car or had suspicions about it. Even people outside the football family knew. Pauline Saternow, then the school's compliance officer, had such misgivings about the car that she recused herself from the investigation committee because, according to Cochran, she did not feel she could be objective. Everyone raised an eyebrow -- except Tressel.
Today Isaac runs High Impact Football, a quarterback-coaching business in Cary, N.C. He is quick to call Tressel his "surrogate dad." The two were once so close that Tressel invited Isaac to a football camp, even after Isaac had been indicted for jury tampering. They text-messaged psalms back and forth, according to Isaac, who says the coach taught him his most important life lessons. "He never let me take the path of least resistance," Isaac says.
Tressel was aware of the car. At times, Isaac told SI, he asked the coach for help in getting out of traffic tickets. "He'd slot out two hours to meet and say, 'Ray, I need you to read this book and give me 500 words on why it's important to be a good student-athlete,'" Isaac says. Afterward the ticket would sometimes disappear, which, if Tressel intervened, would be an NCAA infraction.
In February 2000, 11 months before Ohio State hired Tressel, Youngstown State acknowledged numerous football violations and announced self-imposed sanctions, including the loss of two scholarships. Because it was satisfied with those steps and its statute of limitations on the violations had run out, the NCAA allowed Youngstown to keep the '91 national title, one of four Tressel won with the Penguins. Cochran, who is now retired, still shakes his head over Tressel's contradictions. There was the Christian who lifted kids out of troubled neighborhoods and built a football "family," Cochran says, and there was the coach who claimed to have been kept in the dark after he had assiduously avoided the light. "What bothered me was that the family knows," Cochran says. "Inside the family everyone knows what's going on."

Columbus may be north of the Mason-Dixon Line, and Ohio State may be a Big Ten school, but the manner in which the city's inhabitants seek to associate with members of the football team is seen more often in Southeastern Conference towns such as Tuscaloosa and Knoxville. The legendary Hayes had a group of boosters -- initially called the Frontliners -- who scouted and courted recruits. There was also a Columbus car dealer who gave Hayes's players generous discounts in exchange for tickets to games. But the NCAA ban on such assistance in 1983 marked the end of such groups, though some of the former Frontliners kept their sense of purpose. They continued to do favors for recruits and players -- a free dinner here, some cash there. "In this town there almost needs to be, like the security screening at the airport, something that beeps and lets you know that a booster has a bad moral compass," says Columbus lawyer Geoffrey Webster, an Ohio State alumnus and donor who was given a 2002 national championship ring by Tressel.
Stepping into that environment in 2001, Tressel had two options. He could set a hard line with his players and the boosters, or he could go with the flow. The first indication of Tressel's choice came in 2003, when the NCAA investigated Clarett for receiving improper benefits. Clarett was evasive, answering "I don't know" to many of the investigators' questions. The NCAA and Ohio State eventually ruled that he had received improper benefits, including taking money from and allowing his cellphone bill to be paid by a man who lived near Youngstown. Ohio State suspended Clarett for the '03 season.
A year later, after he left the university, Clarett told ESPN that he wasn't forthcoming with the NCAA because it would have meant ratting on teammates and coaches. He alleged that Tressel had -arranged cars for him to use and that the coach's older brother Dick, who was then the Buckeyes' director of football operations (he is now the team's running backs coach), arranged lucrative no-show jobs for players. (Jim and Dick Tressel have denied the allegations.) Clarett added that coaches connected him with boosters who gave him thousands of dollars.
The NCAA never sanctioned Ohio State for any of those allegations. Clarett didn't respond when investigators tried to contact him after the ESPN story, so they weren't able to proceed. Like the Youngstown State whistle-blower years earlier, Clarett was dismissed as disgruntled.
Now NCAA investigators and Ohio State are both looking into the use of cars by several current Buckeyes, including Pryor, who, a source close to one of the investigations told SI, might have driven as many as eight cars in his three years in Columbus. (Ohio State declined to make Pryor available for comment.) Former Buckeyes basketball player Mark Titus posted on his blog on May 24 that it was common knowledge among students that football players were driving cars too pricey for their means. "You'd have to be blind to not notice it," he wrote. Former wide receiver Ray Small confirmed last week to The Lantern, the Ohio State student newspaper, that he got a "deal" on a car from a Columbus dealer, but he did not provide the terms.
"As fans we always write off what goes on behind the scenes," says Webster. "We say it is no big deal because we so enjoy watching these fellas play. But maybe we need to pay more attention to what is going on behind the curtain."
Webster got a peek in 2004 while working as an attorney for Poly-Care, a Columbus-based supplier of health-care products. He says an employee informed him of a phone conversation involving Poly-Care cofounder Robert Q. Baker during which Baker talked of a payment to Smith, the Buckeyes' quarterback, and said, "Now I own him."
Some have portrayed Baker as a rogue booster who committed a single forbidden act. But Tressel and Ohio State had reason to suspect that Baker had violated NCAA rules -almost a year earlier. The Dayton Daily News reported that Chris Gamble, a cornerback and wide receiver who now plays for the NFL's Panthers, was paid by Baker in the summer of 2003 for a job that consisted of little more than showing up and signing autographs. The Columbus Dispatch wrote that Gamble accompanied Baker on golf outings and even called Baker at halftime of the '04 Fiesta Bowl.
Baker isn't an Ohio State grad, but he owned a share of a luxury box at Ohio Stadium. On the wall of his Poly-Care office, Baker hung a picture of Lee Tressel, for whom he played at Baldwin-Wallace.
Ohio State's investigation of Gamble's relationship with Baker found no wrongdoing; school officials accepted Gamble's explanation that his job included tasks other than signing autographs. Still, Tressel could have forbidden his players to interact with a die-hard booster such as Baker. Instead, about a year after Gamble's relationship with Baker was brought to Tressel's attention, Smith went to Poly-Care looking for a job and left with $500. After a tip from Webster, the university investigated and suspended Smith for the 2004 Alamo Bowl; the NCAA later banned him for a second game.
The Clarett and Baker scandals were further evidence that Tressel was, at best, woefully ignorant of questionable behavior by his players and not aggressive enough in preventing it. At worst, he was a conduit for improper benefits, as Clarett alleged. The latter interpretation is suggested by a story that has long circulated among college coaches and was confirmed to SI by a former colleague of Tressel's from Earle Bruce's staff at Ohio State in the mid-1980s. One of Tressel's duties then was to organize and run the Buckeyes' summer camp. Most of the young players who attended it would never play college football, but a few were top prospects whom Ohio State was recruiting. At the end of camp, attendees bought tickets to a raffle with prizes such as cleats and a jersey. According to his fellow assistant, Tressel rigged the raffle so that the elite prospects won -- a potential violation of NCAA rules. Says the former colleague, who asked not to be identified because he still has ties to the Ohio State community, "In the morning he would read the Bible with another coach. Then, in the afternoon, he would go out and cheat kids who had probably saved up money from mowing lawns to buy those raffle tickets. That's Jim Tressel."













On the corner of West Broad Street and Rodgers Avenue in West -Columbus, in a neighborhood appropriately called the Bottoms, sits a shuttered storefront. It has been vacant for some time, but a spray-painted board still hangs above the door, informing passersby that the building was once home to Dudley'z Tattoos & Body Piercing.
Ohio State fans are more familiar with another tattoo parlor, Fine Line Ink, a few miles west. That is where Pryor and several current teammates traded signed memorabilia for tattoos and cash. Buckeyes supporters have been led to believe that the wrongdoing was limited to Pryor and his five suspended teammates and took place only at Fine Line Ink beginning in 2008. "We're very fortunate that we do not have a systemic problem in our program," Ohio State athletic director Gene Smith said last December. "This is isolated to these young men and isolated to this particular instance."
In reality, Ohio State players have been trading memorabilia --- including items bearing Tressel's signature -- since at least the coach's second season, according to multiple -sources. The number of players -involved is also much higher than what has previously been disclosed.
Dustin Halko was an artist at Dudley'z from the fall of 2002 until early '04, and he says that players regularly visited the shop and handed over signed jerseys, gloves, magazines and other goods in exchange for tattoos. Halko says he personally inked at least 10 Ohio State players -- he clearly remembers tattooing guard T.J. Downing, tight end Louis Irizarry and wide receiver Chris Vance -- and in return he was given autographed memorabilia. (Downing denies ever entering Dudley'z and says that if his memorabilia was there it had been stolen out of his locker; Irizarry and Vance could not be reached for comment despite extensive efforts to contact them.) Halko says that more players, including Clarett (who declined to comment), traded with other artists, and he estimates that at least 15 players violated NCAA rules at Dudley'z just as Pryor & Co. did at Fine Line Ink. Two associates of Halko's who hung out at the shop -- they asked not be named because they fear reprisals from Ohio State fans -- confirmed Halko's account that players commonly swapped memorabilia for tattoo work. One said he saw "at least five" Buckeyes conduct such transactions; the other said "at least seven."
"What they brought in depended on the kind of tattoo they wanted," says Halko. "If it was just something small, it might be a signed magazine or something like that. If it was a full sleeve, they might bring in a jersey." (Tattoos range in price from less than $100 for simple designs to several thousand dollars for more elaborate ones like the full-sleeve inkings of some Buckeyes.) Halko says those working in the shop preferred receiving items with multiple autographs. His most memorable acquisition was a scarlet-and-gray training jacket with between 10 and 15 signatures on it, including Tressel's. Halko says he also traded tattoo work for a magazine bearing the coach's autograph.
According to Halko and both of his associates, Dudley'z became a social hub for the athletes. On a Friday or Saturday night a dozen or more Buckeyes could be found in the large back room of the parlor. They danced to music spun by a deejay and sipped drinks or smoked marijuana that was provided by people at the shop.
Darrell (Dudley) Ross, who owned Dudley'z, initially told SI that Halko was lying in saying that Ohio State players were tattooed there and partied there, and that Halko was "just trying to get his name in the paper." Ross later acknowledged that he might have tattooed some Buckeyes but said that Halko did not and that the players always paid for the work. Ross said that Halko worked at Dudley'z for "three or four days" and said of himself, "Look, I am a career criminal, but I've only been convicted of one felony. I'm not a drug addict like [Halko]."
Megan Zonars, who says she lived in an apartment above Dudley'z for about six months beginning in June 2003, contradicts Ross's account that Halko was employed only briefly at the tattoo parlor. She told SI that Halko worked at the parlor "every day" while she lived there. Like the two associates of Halko's who spoke to SI, she also confirmed Halko's account that many Buckeyes frequented the shop. "I met Chris Vance and Maurice Clarett and others," she said. "And it wasn't just [Halko] who needled guys. A lot of people worked on Buckeyes."
Halko does have a troubling background and, like Clarett, is easily impeached by those unsettled by his allegations. In 2005 he was found guilty of assault and sentenced to 180 days in jail. In '08 he was convicted of misdemeanor theft and possession of drug paraphernalia, and last year he violated a protection order. In March he was sentenced to a year in prison after being convicted of three felonies: attempted burglary, breaking and entering, and domestic violence. He spoke to SI in a series of phone calls from Noble Correctional Institution in Caldwell, Ohio. He said that in addition to his legal trouble, he has had a drug problem in the past, "but I'm not lying. Why should I lie?"
After Halko left Dudley'z in 2004 he opened his own shop, which he operated for about a year. Then he pleaded guilty to assault and served time in prison. After his release, he bounced around, eventually landing a job at, of all places, Fine Line Ink, in 2009. Halko was at first surprised to see Ohio State football players regularly come through the door, but it made sense. Dudley'z had closed, and the Buckeyes needed a new hangout.
Halko worked at Fine Line Ink for only a few weeks and says he did not witness the transactions involving the six Ohio State players who would be suspended. Nor did he see the drug trafficking that would lead federal prosecutors to indict owner Edward Rife. In a plea deal last Friday, Rife pleaded guilty to money laundering and conspiracy and possession with intent to distribute 100 kilograms or more of marijuana, offenses that carry a maximum sentence of 60 years in prison and a fine of up to $2.5 million.
In its letter to Ohio State, the Department of Justice linked Rife, 31, to Ross, the Dudley'z owner. The letter listed transactions between the two involving six pieces of signed memorabilia. There was also a footnote: "Ross is a friend of Edward Rife, who deals in sports memorabilia." Asked about his relationship with Rife, Ross told SI he knew him but couldn't comment further.
On what would be his last day at Fine Line, Halko says Rife accused him of stealing some cameras, which Halko denied. He also says that Rife, the man who would become close with many of Ohio State's best players, then pointed a gun at him and ordered some of his associates to take him outside and beat him. Halko says he ended up in Mount Carmel West Hospital with multiple injuries, a description confirmed by one of Halko's associates. Rife's lawyer, Stephen Palmer, told SI that Rife denies pulling a gun on Halko or having him assaulted.

On the second floor of the nondescript building that houses Fine Line Ink, Rife created the ultimate Ohio State-themed man cave. Huge photographs hung on walls painted scarlet and gray. Images of Hayes and former Michigan coach Bo Schembechler sandwiched a picture of Ohio Stadium. There were shots from the 2003 Fiesta Bowl, where the Buckeyes won the national title, including one of Tressel. Signature-covered jerseys were displayed, and on a small table was an autographed helmet encased in glass. A large sectional couch sat in front of a big flat-screen television that was hooked up to a PlayStation3.
"It was a cool place to hang out," says a former Rife employee. "Everybody could just relax and have a good time. The players were catered to. Eddie would tell people, 'Go get them some chicken' or 'Run to the store and get them something to drink.' Whatever they wanted." The former employee, who worked for Rife from the fall of 2008 until last summer, agreed to speak to SI on condition that he remain anonymous; he fears that Rife or one of his associates will seek retribution for his disclosures. He will be referred to in this story by the pseudonym Ellis.
Ohio State has conceded that six current players committed an NCAA violation by trading memorabilia for tattoos or cash at Fine Line Ink: Pryor, tackle Mike Adams, running back Dan Herron, wide receiver DeVier Posey, defensive end Solomon Thomas and linebacker Jordan Whiting. Ellis, who spent time in and around the tattoo parlor for nearly 20 months, says that in addition to those six, he witnessed nine other active players swap memorabilia or give autographs for tattoos or money. Those players were defensive back C.J. Barnett, linebacker Dorian Bell, running back Jaamal Berry, running back Bo DeLande, defensive back Zach Domicone, linebacker Storm Klein, linebacker Etienne Sabino, defensive tackle John Simon and defensive end Nathan Williams. Ohio State declined to make any of its current players available to respond to SI.
Ellis claims that two players whose eligibility expired at the close of the 2010 season -- safety Jermale Hines and cornerback Devon Torrence -- also conducted at least one transaction with Rife involving memorabilia or autographs before the season ended. When asked by SI to respond, Hines, who was picked by the Rams in the fifth round of April's NFL draft, said, "I did nothing illegal." Torrence's agent, Jim Ivler, said his client "is adamant that the allegations are false. ... He can tell you where he got all his tattoos and it was not [at Fine Line Ink]."
From the 2008 team, Ellis alleges that cornerback Donald Washington traded memorabilia for tattoos. Washington now plays for the Chiefs; his agent, Neil Cornrich, did not return SI's calls requesting comment.

Among those whose Ohio State careers ended after the 2009 season, Rose, Small, defensive end Thaddeus Gibson, running back Jermil Martin, wide receiver Lamaar Thomas and defensive lineman Doug Worthington made trades or sold memorabilia before their eligibility expired, according to Ellis. Gibson, now with the 49ers, and Worthington, now with the Buccaneers, declined comment through their agent. Repeated attempts to locate Martin, including calls, Internet searches and Facebook messages to past friends and coaches, were unsuccessful. Thomas, who now plays for the University of New Mexico, said in a statement from that school's athletic office, "I'm aware of the investigation at Ohio State. I have not been implicated for a reason -- because I've done nothing wrong." When asked about Buckeyes selling their players-only merchandise, Small admitted to The Lantern that he had done so and said that "everybody was doing it."
Rose has no regrets. "I knew how much money that the school was making," he says. "I always heard about how Ohio State had the biggest Nike budget. I was struggling, my mom was struggling. ... It was just something that I had to do. I was in a hard spot. ... [Other] guys were doing it for the same reasons. The university doesn't really help. Technically we knew it was wrong, but a lot of those guys are from the inner city and we didn't have much, and we had to go on the best we could. I couldn't call home to ask my mom to help me out."
Ohio State's conclusion that only six players broke the rules is based in part on a list of the items the Department of Justice seized in raids of Fine Line Ink and Rife's home on May 1, 2010. But that list, which mentioned 42 football-related items that Rife bought, received or acquired in trades from players, covered only a small fraction of what he got from the Buckeyes, Ellis says. "Eddie had storage units all over town," he says, "and he also sold some stuff off to people." (Through Palmer, his lawyer, Rife declined to comment on his involvement with Ohio State players.) Ellis estimates that Pryor alone brought in more than 20 items, -including game-worn shoulder pads, multiple helmets, Nike cleats, jerseys, game pants and more. One day Ellis asked Pryor how he was able to take so much gear from the university's equipment room. Ellis says the quarter-back responded, "I get whatever I want."
The Department of Justice alerted Ohio State to a transaction in which an unnamed player gave Rife a watch and four tickets to the 2010 Rose Bowl in exchange for a Chevy Tahoe. That player, Ellis says, was Martin: "Jermil came in to the shop and said, 'Are we doing this deal on this truck?' They went outside, and Eddie signed the title over and Jermil shook his hand and off he went." Martin did not give Rife anything at that moment, Ellis says, but a short time later Rife said in a telephone call to Ellis that he was in Pasadena and that Martin had gotten him tickets.
Martin was particularly close to Rife, Ellis says; about a year earlier Rife had given Martin a different car, a 2004 Jaguar sedan. "Eddie tossed him the keys, and off Jermil drove," Ellis says. (Through Palmer, Rife declined to comment.)
Ellis showed SI pictures of players -- Pryor, Gibson, Herron and Solomon Thomas -- being tattooed or showing off their artwork. Rife appears in one photo with a player. Ellis also produced a photo of 11 plastic bags filled with what appears to be marijuana; he says the photo was taken at Fine Line Ink. The letter the DOJ sent to Ohio State in December stated, "There is no allegation that any of these players were involved in or had knowledge of Mr. Rife's drug trafficking activities." Ellis says that is true but that he did witness four other Buckeyes trade memorabilia for weed. Three of those transactions involved a small amount of the drug, he says, but in one instance a player departed with what Ellis was told was a pound. (Rife's lawyer denies that his client provided marijuana to any players.)
Like Dudley'z years earlier, Fine Line Ink became the players' hangout. They gathered on the second floor, turned on the PlayStation and stayed for hours. Rife may have been about a decade older than most of the players, but, says Ellis, "Eddie was cool. He was funny and fun to be around. The players liked him." Rife regularly accompanied players to bars near campus; he took some to an MMA fight at the LC Pavilion; in May 2009 three players joined Rife at Cruisefest Nationals, an auto show. According to Ellis, Rife set up a mobile tattoo station and then shouted at potential customers, "Come and meet the Buckeyes."
How open a secret was it that scores of Buckeyes were hanging out at Fine Line? Ellis says players went in and out of the tattoo parlor so often that kids carrying paper and pen would bang on the door and front window and shout, "Are the Buckeyes here?" Employees had to shoo them away.
From fall 2002 through last year, first at Dudley'z and then at Fine Line Ink, at least 28 Ohio State players are either known or alleged to have traded or sold memorabilia in violation of NCAA rules. It is a staggering number, a level of wrongdoing that would seem hard to miss for a coach and an entire athletic department -- one that includes an NCAA compliance staff of at least six people. Yet the university trusted the coach, and the coach says he knew nothing before April 2010, when the Columbus lawyer tipped him off in an e-mail.
He was ignorant of it all.
***
In August the NCAA's Committee on Infractions will review the alleged rules violations committed by Tressel and his players. Tressel violated NCAA bylaw 10.1 -- Unethical Conduct, one of the cornerstones of NCAA rulebook -- three times: first by failing to act when tipped off about the tattoo scandal; again last fall, by signing a standard form given to all coaches declaring that he knew of no violations; and then, last December, by not being forthcoming with school officials. Tressel's violations will almost certainly lead to sanctions that will follow him to any school that might hire him, making it highly unlikely that he will coach a major college program again. Like Woody Hayes, the ruination at the end of his Ohio State career will tail him forever.
The university's search for a permanent replacement will surely include a call to former Florida coach Urban Meyer, who like Tressel was an assistant under Earle Bruce. Meyer has bristled at talk that he would become the Buckeyes' coach, and he and other top candidates will probably wait and see what the Committee on Infractions decides. Despite Gene Smith's insistence to the contrary, the school had a systemic problem and is likely to be hit with heavy sanctions, including the loss of several scholarships.
Ohio State officials will argue that the school should be spared, in part because they got rid of Tressel, the head of the program that has been so tainted by wrongdoing. For years, Ohio State benefited from Tressel's choirboy image. Now, the university is likely to paint him as a huge problem that has been eliminated for the betterment of the athletic department.
It is not the noblest of tactics, but it adheres to an axio











Bud Robertson is 62, recently retired, and wealthy enough after a long business career that he doesn't have to work another day in his life. He's in great shape, is full of energy, and lives in a big house in Groton, Mass., that looks like an antebellum mansion uprooted from a Georgia plantation. Divorced for six years, he has time to spend with his girlfriend, three sports cars -- a 1958 Bugeye Sprite, a 1956 Chevy hardtop, and a 1981 Corvette -- and his two children and five grandchildren.
But don't envy Bud Robertson. In fact, hang out with him for a while, and you almost feel bad for the guy. Because on a recent spring morning he is not lounging at home in his pajamas or snorkeling in the Bahamas. Instead he is sitting in a conference room in Boston with Mike Jeans, the president of a firm called New Directions that, among other services, helps retired executives like Robertson figure out what to do with themselves when they can't boss people around anymore.
"Bud, I want you to take a pad of paper and write down a list of 200 people you intend to contact," Jeans says.
"Two hundred?" Robertson says, startled. "I could find 20, but I don't know about 200." Just think about everyone you know, says Jeans. "Former colleagues, attorneys, accountants, financial planners, recruiters, college alumni, people from church ..."
I am supposed to be silently observing this coaching session, the proverbial fly on the wall, but I can't help myself. "Wait a minute," I break in, "that doesn't sound like retirement. That sounds like job networking."
"Networking has two purposes," Jeans says. "To get on a board of directors and stay on people's radar screen so he doesn't get lost."
But why not get lost? Dude spent his whole life playing the game. If ever there were a time in Bud Robertson's life to get lost, wouldn't this be it?
Jeans turns to Robertson and says, "Bud, I want you to take six months off and not do anything."
"No," says Robertson.
And there you have it -- the existential dilemma of the successful, retired baby boomer. Once upon a time you worked for 40 years, then played golf or sat in a rocking chair waiting for your arteries to calcify. Maybe you hated it, but you didn't complain. Then came Viagra, liposuction, Tony Robbins, and all the other inventions that made boomers the most annoying generation ever. Now they are being dragged into retirement -- the first wave of boomers turns 65 this year -- and they are not going gentle into that good night. But they are not exactly raging against the dying of the light either. Mostly they are just confused. Says Jeans: "A lot of folks are emotional wrecks."















When Jonathan Adams lost his job last December, he didn't panic -- or pull all of his savings out of the market.
They were lucky. Adams, a former mortgage broker, and his wife Kendall, had stashed away a rainy day fund of $25,000 over the years.
During the past six months, they've tapped into those savings to supplement Kendall's income as a part-time public relations coordinator to pay for household bills as well as for Jonathan's executive MBA classes.
They were also prudent.
"We've scaled back our day-to-day expenses, and I'm back in school to help reinvent myself as I'm hunting for a new job," said Jonathan, 32, of Louisville, Ky.
As the Adams' emergency fund dwindles, they say the next step in their plan is to dip into the $50,000 they have parked in a floating-rate fund, which invests in bonds with interest rates that would rise along with the market.
Many don't have $2,000 for a rainy day
That should cover their short-term needs. They're hoping that Jonathan, who has been interviewing, will land a job soon so they can leave the $125,000 sitting in an IRA untouched.
"We consider our retirement money to be a last resort," said Jonathan. "Things would have to be really rough for that money to really be up grabs."
And experts say the Adams' strategy is exactly right.
"Investors often panic when they're going through a job transition and don't consider the tax consequences and penalties of cashing out of their retirement savings built in a 401k or IRA," said Beth McHugh, vice president of market insights for Fidelity.
Investors who withdraw money from their retirement accounts before they hit the age of 59-1/2 must pay income taxes on their earnings plus a 10% penalty fee.
Two-thirds of investors who opt to cash out of their long-term investments after losing their job typically regret the move, according to a Fidelity survey.
"Investors should leave their retirement account alone," said Christine Benz, director of personal finances at Morningstar. "They wouldn't be contributing to it while unemployed, but they don't have to change how the assets are allocated."








To avoid being sorry, experts say trim down your expenses to the necessities and use any cash you have stowed away.
If you've got reserves for about six months of the basic expenses covered, you can invest in the market, said Frank Lamkin, CEO and chief investment strategist at Lamkin Wealth Management.
But investing while unemployed comes with risk so it pays to be cautious.
Stay cool when news gets scary
"We don't advise people to get out of their investments when they lose their job, but they have to be prudent," said Frank Fantozzi, CEO of Planned Financial Services, a wealth management firm in Cleveland. "They need to minimize risks and change up their portfolio so it can provide a certain level of income."
He recommends the Pimco Total Return Fund (PTTDX), which invests in U.S. government, corporate, municipal and foreign bonds.
Bonds are a good bet because they are relatively safe and the interest you earn can see you through up to five years. Fantozzi also likes blue chip stocks that pay dividends, such as Procter & Gamble (PG, Fortune 500) and AT&T (T, Fortune 500).
He said plenty of funds, such as the Vanguard Wellington Fund (VWELX), capture both strategies since they invest in dividend paying stocks as well as fixed income securities such as corporate or municipal bonds, and U.S. Treasuries.
"Think about stair stepping your portfolio: what you need on hand immediately should be in cash, and what you might need within a few year should be in bonds," said Benz.  










So lukewarm that economists at Goldman Sachs last week cut their economic growth forecast for the second time in a month, only to warn a few days later that "we already see downside risk to that estimate."

Headed in the wrong direction?
Goldman now sees the U.S. economy struggling to limp forth at a 3% pace in the second quarter, down from 3.5% just three weeks ago and 4% at the start of the year. The firm expects the economy to have added just 150,000 jobs in April ¨C down from 244,000 in March and well below the 178,000 CNNMoney forecast.
Economist Zach Pandl rounds up the usual suspects, blaming high oil prices, manufacturing disruptions triggered by the earthquake in Japan and various other temporary factors (such as tornadoes in the South and a drop in defense spending).
But those alone can hardly account for all the slack in what was supposed to be a reasonably vigorous recovery by now, he says. All signs point toward a broad-based slowdown, rather than one tied to temporary factors.
"Special factors do seem important, but they cannot explain all the recent weakness in the data, and the economy does seem to have slowed," Pandl writes in a note to clients Friday. "We are somewhat puzzled by this because many of the trends that made us more optimistic around yearend 2010¡ªprogress in private sector deleveraging, easier credit and financial conditions, and an improving labor market¡ªare still in place."
Pandl notes that the firm's analyst index ¨C which tracks new orders, sales and shipments, employment, materials prices and inventories ¨C has fallen to levels last seen during the spring 2010 slowdown that ended only when the Fed promised to stoke up activity with the bond-buying plan dubbed QE2. If you think the Fed is going to have trouble walking away from quantitative easing, you aren't alone.
Goldman is hardly the only firm to be humming this tune lately. Economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch last week cut their second-quarter growth forecast 2%, warning that a run of "dreary" data doesn't seem likely to end suddenly.
But Goldman was so bullish at the end of last year that a pronounced darkening in its outlook is ominous ¨C and there is every reason to believe the bad news isn't over. Another day, another giant problem for Ben Bernanke.
"If the data flow fails to improve in coming months," says Pandl, "we may need to consider a further downgrade to our US growth forecasts."

River City High School cheerleaders were targets of a mean spirited article published in this year's yearbook, and several hundred copies of the book were picked up by students Friday.

Subsequently school staff were suspending pickups until the yearbook editor helped rewrite a replacement page.

The article was titled, "Who Wears Short Shorts" and described the cheer squad as showing "more leg than Daisy Duke" and being "dolled up in micromini(sic) uniforms" while "strolling down halls" with "blatant disregard" for River City High's "school dress code."

The article came complete with pictures taken while the teams skirts were high up after completing a jump exercise.

A second page also showed digitally edited pictures with only the legs of some girls shown.

"Ugh! I was really mad. I was shaking," said cheerleader Breannah Gully after picking up her yearbook. "And I started reading, and everyone had to tell me to calm down and I was just angry at the words, and I called my mom and I was crying."

"I'm pissed," said Breannah's mother Michelle Gully. "We spent a lot of money on these uniforms - we don't even get to pick the uniform."

Gully senior added, "My concern is they're letting the students write this, edit this and print this."

River City staff gave parents copies of the education code showing that state law allows for the language. Some school officials said because of a court case - referred to as "Hazelwood" - officials were forced to leave the final editorial decisions to the students.

Hazelwood is a late '80s Supreme Court ruling that gives principals the power to review and censor high school newspapers. The Court ruled that "educators do not offend the First Amendment by exercising editorial control over the style and content of student speech in school-sponsored expressive activities so long as their actions are reasonably related to legitimate pedagogical concerns."

A River City Vice Principal said the article didn't create libel, so all they could do was strongly encourage the editor to "make the right decision."

The 16 year old responsible for writing the article wrote a response saying, "I deeply regret submitting this page to my adviser, as well as letting it be published. I made an editorial mistake and I apologize for any pain that I may have caused. I did not mean for this spread to be malicious or maleconent in any way. This page was not an attack on the cheerleaders; it was not out of spite. While I did try out for the team in 2009, I carry no resentment towards the cheerleaders or their families. We [the yearbook staff] are currently taking steps to make amends. Again, I apologize for any hurt that I may have caused."

School officials said 400 books were picked up by students Friday. The remaining 600 will not be handed out until the cheer squad article is replaced.










Chinese authorities Monday arrested dozens of demonstrators in Hohhot as protests spread to the provincial capital and other cities in Inner Mongolia despite tightened security and reports of martial law, activists told CNN.
"Several hundred people, mostly students and ordinary Hohhot residents, gathered at Xinhua Square around 11 a.m. Monday, chanting slogans and holding signs demanding legal rights for the Mongolia people," said Enghebatu Togochog, director of the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center. "Paramilitary troops dispersed the crowd after an hour and dozens were arrested."
Sources in the city told him the protest turnout was much smaller than planned, Togochog said, as officials sealed local campuses and shut down social media. He added that, in addition to Hohhot, the government has also deployed paramilitary troops into Tongliao, Chifeng and other cities, putting more areas in Inner Mongolia under de facto martial law.
Local officials continue to dispute activists' accounts, even as state-run media reported some conciliatory gestures by the government.
"There was no protest in downtown Hohhot," Wen Fei, an official with Inner Mongolia's foreign affairs office, told CNN. "Everything is normal and there is no martial law."
Protests engulf Inner Mongolia

"All students are free to move around," echoed Ji Shugang, a spokesman for the government of Xilin Gol prefecture. "Journalists are welcome here, but you need to apply for permission first."
Xilin Gol is the site of one of the largest protests last week, as an estimated 2,000 Mongolian students took to the streets to show solidarity with a Mongolian herder, who was struck and killed by a Chinese coal truck driver.
In an unusual move, Inner Mongolia's Communist Party chief visited the Xilin Gol area Friday to meet with students and teachers, the Inner Mongolia Daily reported. Hu Chunhua said authorities had detained the suspects in the herder's death and promised swift punishment to those found responsible, according to the newspaper.
The government has also sacked a top local official and pledged to better manage the mining industry to reduce its impact on herders' livelihood.
The Beijing-based Global Times, a mass-circulating tabloid, ran an editorial Tuesday, calling some demands of "largely peaceful protesters" in Inner Mongolia "reasonable" while accusing Western media of exaggerating ethnic clashes in the region.
Activists acknowledge officials' effort to calm tensions, but doubted their sincerity in resolving the dispute long term. They say the government's push in recent years to expand coal mining in areas traditionally used for grazing has threatened the very existence of Mongolian herders and their culture.
"Officials just temporarily shut down a coal mine where the herder was killed," Togochog said. "Hu Chunhua still stated development must go on, so they won't halt coal mining and production in the area forever."
The grassroots and peaceful nature of the Mongolian demonstrations has made it difficult for authorities to justify a harsh crackdown, he added, noting Beijing's more heavy-handed responses in the past to protests by Tibetans and Uighur Muslims.
"By carrying out this non-violent movement, Mongolians are gaining confidence in people power, in its ability to demand changes," he said.
The Chinese government has hailed Inner Mongolia as a "model autonomous region" with rapid economic growth -- spurred by the mining industry -- and ethnic harmony. With the recent unrest gaining international attention, Beijing is playing down the ethnic dimension.
"Local authorities are trying to balance environmental protection and economic development," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu commented Tuesday on the herder's death. "Overseas parties who try to use this incident to stir up trouble have ulterior motives."
Mongolians have lived in the area for centuries, but the Han Chinese -- who arrived in large numbers after the founding of the People's Republic in 1949 -- now make up almost 80 percent of Inner Mongolia's population.












South Korea said Tuesday it regrets North Korea's announcement that it will cut all ties with its neighbor.
North Korea's National Defence Commission issued a statement Monday saying it "will never deal with traitor Lee Myung-bak and his clan" referring to the South Korean president and accusing Seoul of "psychological warfare."
The North said it would launch an "all-out offensive" against Seoul for allowing anti-Pyongyang propaganda to be sent by human rights groups and some politicians in balloons across the border.
Pyongyang has often made such threats in the past through its state-owned news agency KCNA.
"We regard it as disappointing that North Korea came out with quite a strong statement yesterday," said South Korean Foreign Ministry spokesman Cho Byung-jae on Tuesday. "We think it is time for North Korea to be serious about dialogue and show transformed efforts."
Lee had invited North Korea to next year's nuclear security summit in Berlin on the condition Pyongyang renounced nuclear weapons.
Tensions have been high on the Korean peninsula since the sinking in March 2010 of the South Korean warship, the Cheonan -- which an international investigation blamed on the North -- and the shelling in November of Yeongpyeong Island, which killed two South Korean marines and two civilians.









South Korea launched an investigation Tuesday into reports of toxic chemicals being dumped at a former U.S. military base, the Defense Ministry said.
The tests follow allegations of American soldiers burying chemicals on Korean soil.
The first tests are being carried out by a joint military, government and civilian task force at the site of what was Camp Mercer, west of Seoul.
"Soil and underground water will be taken in the areas where toxic chemicals were allegedly buried," said the statement from the South Korean Defense Ministry. Once testing is finished, the government will decide on how to test more than 80 other sites -- all former bases.
The alarm was raised this month when a U.S. veteran alleged barrels of the toxic herbicide Agent Orange were buried at an American base in South Korea in the late 1970s. Two of his fellow soldiers corroborated his story about Camp Carroll, about 185 miles (300 kilometers) southeast of the capital, Seoul.
"We've been working very closely with the Korean government since we had the initial claims," said Lt. Gen. John Johnson, who is heading the Camp Carroll Task Force. "If we get evidence that there is a risk to health, we are going to fix it."
A joint U.S.- South Korean investigation is being conducted at Camp Carroll to test the validity of allegations.
The U.S. military sprayed Agent Orange from planes onto jungles in Vietnam to kill vegetation in an effort to expose guerrilla fighters.

The Dalai Lama has formally relinquished his political and administrative powers, a spokesman said Tuesday.
The Tibetan spiritual leader approved amendments to the exiled constitution to enable him to devolve his political responsibilities into the community's elected leadership and judiciary, according to officials.
Lobsang Choedak, a spokesman for the exiled Tibetan government, said the changes were carried out during a three-day session of its parliament in the Himalayan town of Dharamsala, India. The Dalai Lama approved them Sunday.
The amendments came after a special assembly of Tibetans urged the Dalai Lama to reconsider his decision to cede his ceremonial powers, a plea he rejected, Choedak said.

Lobsang Sangay, who was elected head of Tibet's government-in-exile last month, now fills the shoes of the Dalai Lama as "head of state," Choedak said.
But the Dalai Lama remains the spiritual leader of the global Tibetan community. In March, the Dalai Lama announced his plan to retire as political head of the Tibetan exile movement, saying the community needed an elected leader "to whom I can devolve power."
"The essence of a democratic system is, in short, the assumption of political responsibility by elected leaders for the popular good," he said in his March message to Tibet's parliament-in-exile. "In order for our process of democratization to be complete, the time has come for me to devolve my formal authority to such an elected leadership."
The Dalai Lama fled China 52 years ago, on March 10, 1959, after a failed uprising against Chinese rule.










 Amid deepening public concerns over the country's food safety following a wave of recent scandals, China's highest court has ordered judges nationwide to hand down harsher sentences, including the death penalty, to people convicted of violating food safety regulations.
In a directive released by the state-run Xinhua news agency over the weekend, the Supreme People's Court said in cases where people die from food safety violations, convicted suspects should be given the death sentence, while criminals involved in non-lethal cases should face longer prison terms and larger fines.
It also called for harsher punishment for government officials found protecting food safety violators or accepting bribes from them.
"The overall food safety situation is stable and improving, but incidents that still occur regularly have seriously endangered people's lives and caused strong social reactions," the directive quoted Wang Shengjun, the country's top judge, as saying. "Our task to maintain food safety remains challenging."

Food Safety
From milk laced with melamine, pigs fed with performance-enhancing drugs to watermelons juiced up with growth-stimulating chemicals, a series of recent scandals have outraged Chinese consumers, despite ramped-up government crackdown and state media campaign against food safety violations.
From last September to April this year, Chinese courts have tried and convicted 106 people accused of violating food safety, including two who received life imprisonment last month in a "melamine milk" case, Xinhua reported.
"It's clear that the credibility of the system will suffer," said Peter K. Ben Embarek, the World Health Organization's food safety official. "The (Chinese) consumer will continue to lose confidence in Chinese products and consumers abroad will equally lose confidence in Chinese products."
The latest announcement by China's supreme court, however, seems to run counter to another recent initiative to limit the use of the death penalty by the same court.
In its annual work report, the Supreme People's Court last week instructed lower courts to suspend death sentences for two years if an immediate execution is not deemed necessary.
The Chinese legislature had earlier amended the country's penal code to reduce the number of crimes punishable by death by 13 to 55.
China executes more people than all other countries combined, according to Amnesty International. It estimated the figure, considered a state secret, to be in the thousands last year for "a wide range of crimes that include non-violent offences."
The number of executions elsewhere in the world in 2010 was at least 527, according to the London-based group's annual report released earlier this year.











The Chinese government has stepped up censorship of local television in a sign of the broadening of a political crackdown that has landed many dissidents in jail.
Hunan Broadcasting System, the most commercially successful state broadcaster which also has ambitions to expand overseas, told the Financial Times that it was overhauling its programming to comply with new government censorship demands.
"We must raise the quality of our programs and make them in a way that they're acceptable to the government, the market and the audience," Ouyang Changlin, the director of the HBS, said in a rare interview.
The Chinese broadcasting regulator recently warned TV stations not to focus exclusively on "entertainment". While the order was vague, it was seen as a crackdown as Chinese censors often mix campaigns against political dissent with those against vulgar content.
The tougher line comes as the government tries to strengthen its grip on power in the face of increasingly open dissent and power struggles within the party. Liberal and hardline members of the party are jockeying for position ahead of the 2012 leadership transition when the party will select members for the politburo.
China has severely clamped down on activists since February when an anonymous online appeal called for demonstrations along the lines of the "jasmine revolution" sweeping north Africa and the Middle East.
Authorities have detained scores of human rights lawyers, activists, and writers. They have also arrested Ai Weiwei, the contemporary artist.
The clampdown also comes before the June 4 anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre ahead of which the government tends to smother dissent.
As it prepares for its 90th anniversary in early July, the Communist party has launched a propaganda push to spread "red" culture, including songs praising the party and television dramas narrating its history.
In the latest evidence of tighter political controls, the State Administration for Radio, Film and Television told HBS and other television stations that benchmarks for measuring the success of programs had to change. It said broadcasters should let "quality, responsibility and values" guide their programming.
In 2005, the regulator told HBS to stop running "Super Girl", China's first televised talent show which was the closest thing the country had to American Idol, and on which the station made its name and fortune.
Some officials saw the program, which many people would consider innocent, as subversive because it propelled individuals to fame based on audience votes. It demonstrated the power of popular opinion in China -- a constant concern for the Communist party in a country where people cannot elect their leaders.
While HBS has been a pioneer in the Chinese market, it also harbors international ambitions. Last year, the station did a deal with a unit of ITV, the UK's biggest commercial station, to develop shows in China for export.
Mr Ouyang, who also serves as HBS's Communist party secretary, denied rumors that the regulator had asked the station to follow Chongqing TV, the broadcaster of a western Chinese municipality which has replaced commercials with "red" programming.
"The government may like 'red' programs, but if nobody watches your program, that's good for nothing," he said in defense of his pro-market approach.











Economic data and analysis out of Japan Tuesday underscore the struggles in the world's third largest economy, and how the lack of clear policy is adding to the problems.
Japan's unemployment rate rose to 4.7% in April, up 0.1% from March. It was the first jump in unemployment in six months in the wake of the 9.0 earthquake and tsunami, reported Japan's Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications. The data did not factor in three hardest hit prefectures in the tsunami region: Iwate, Miyagi and Fukushima. Those areas saw massive infrastructure and job losses, suggesting the actual unemployment in the country is worse than today's figures suggest.
Separate employment data showed the number of jobs available dropped for the first time in 17 months. The number of jobs available deteriorated to 0.61 in April from 0.63 in March. The figures from the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare show only 61 jobs are available for every 100 job seekers.
Japanese production on the rise
The labor department also reported average wages in Japan shrank last month for the second straight month, down 1.4% as compared to the year before. Average spending by Japanese households fell by 3.0% last month as compared to the year before.
There was some brighter data on industrial production, rising 1.0% in April from the previous month. The jump is a significant rebound from March, when it fell a record 15.5% in the wake of the disasters.

2011 Japan Disaster
Japan
Meanwhile, ratings agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Tokyo Electric Power Company, also known as TEPCO, to junk status. In a news release, S&P said it was downgrading the energy company by five notices because a government bailout remained uncertain.
Japan's government, saddled with the highest debt to GDP ratio among developed nations, is considering a number of measures to stimulate the economy, fund the reconstruction in the tsunami region and pay off debt. One measure under consideration is a sales tax hike. Japan's Cabinet Office told CNN they have submitted a joint document to a government advisory panel, which is weighing the possible hike. Media reports speculate the hike could jump from 5% to 10%, a figure that the government said had yet to be determined.
The sales tax could prove politically unpopular, as it did last year for Prime Minister Naoto Kan. Kan pushed the doubling of the consumption tax to 10%, shortly after taking office. The move resulted in a voter backlash, damaging his approval rating and costing his party seats in the upper house of Japan's parliament.
Taking such a step now would be a challenge for the beleaguered prime minister, given that members of his own party have hinted they may turn against him. Rival political members are pledging to lodge a no-confidence motion against Kan this week. The politicians pushing the no-confidence motion forward intend to show their displeasure at Kan's handling of the disaster's aftermath and pressure him to resign.
Kan has faced political fights of his life before. Last year, after only a few months in office, Kan's main political opponent within his own party attempted to take control of the Democratic Party of Japan, effectively taking over the premiership. Kan managed to hold onto the title of party leader.
The political in-fighting remains a persistent problem in Japan's politics, a country that has seen six prime ministers in the last five years. Ratings agency Moody's Investors Service underscored what the political fighting means for the struggling economy, placing the country's local and foreign currency bond ratings on review for possible downgrade.
The factors behind the possible downgrade, said Moody's, are the larger than expected costs of the disasters, weak deficit reduction policy and the vulnerability of a long-term fiscal consolidation strategy.

In an unexpected development, China on Thursday reported a $7.3 billion trade deficit in February as imports soared and exports rose only slightly.

Government officials attributed the cooling exports to Chinese New Year, when the country's manufacturing output slowed dramatically.

Economists had expected China to report a trade surplus in February, albeit a smaller one. The monthly deficit was the country's first since March 2010.

Imports last month totaled $104 billion or 19.4% higher on an annual basis, and exports were $96.7 billion or 2.4% higher, according to China's General Administration of Customs.

The Chinese government has said that it's trying to rebalance its trading relationships by encouraging more consumption within its borders. Domestic consumption is growing at a 20% year-over-year rate.

Experts had anticipated that the holiday, which creates widespread work stopages, would be a factor.

"Factory shutdowns around Chinese New Year will make it hard to come to any firm conclusions about the strength of February's numbers," Mark Williams, senior China economist for Capital Economics, said in a research note.

Some observers speculate that China could be fudging the numbers in response to criticism from the United States and other developed nations.

China's turn to a trade deficit was remarkably quick, considering China's surplus stood at $27.1 billion as recently as October.

The fact that China typically exports more goods than it imports has become a sore point in Washington as the United States struggles with a massive trade deficit.

"What irks the United States is that they don't buy more stuff from us," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist at High Frequency Economics.

A few hours after China's latest data was released, the U.S. government reported its trade deficit widened to a five-month high of $46.3 billion in January, as imports grew faster than exports. The U.S. data lags a month behind China's figures.


As President Obama tries to double U.S. exports by 2015, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and other American policymakers have strongly urged China to allow its currency, the yuan, to appreciate.

U.S. officials argue China is keeping the yuan artificially undervalued, making its exports cheaper in the international marketplace and giving its manufacturers an unfair advantage over American factories.

Still, some argue that the U.S. is fighting an uphill battle. American consumers want the cheap products that China delivers, Weinberg said. As incomes for Chinese consumers rise, why would they pay more for American-made goods?

"We don't want to buy the stuff we produce for U.S. consumers -- why should they?" he said.









Oh, if only we could predict the future, then we might be millionaires today.

This week News Stream, CNN International¡¯s news and tech show, is focusing on some of China¡¯s hottest tech stocks. The business segment I suggested for them: how much money would you have made if you were smart ¨C or lucky ¨C enough to have invested early on and cashed out today. The answers might make you shake your head and wish you had put up some money. Or they might make you smile a bit broader as you head out for your steak and lobster dinner.

Five years ago, share prices for Baidu, Tencent and Sina were affordable to many more investors, ranging between $5 and $30. Today that range has rocketed to the $100 to $200 level ¨C and out of reach to the casual buyer.


Baidu¡¯s performance chart shows its stock price hurtled nearly 2300% higher between 2006 and 2011. It¡¯s now China¡¯s most popular search engine and lays claim to 75% market share in China¡¯s search engine industry ¨C helped in part by Google¡¯s pullout in early 2010.

Tencent¡¯s stock jumped nearly 1400% in the same period. The one-stop online shop for all things digital ¨C from downloading music to dating services ¨C actually owes much of its huge popularity to QQ, China¡¯s premier instant messaging service. And if estimates are true, QQ has the world¡¯s largest online community with more than 600 million users.

Sina¡¯s stock price popped about 270% between 2006 and 2011. The hot news and blog site gets 3 billion page views a day, according to some estimates. And a good deal of Sina¡¯s macro strength in the online world actually comes from its microblog, known as Weibo. That¡¯s China¡¯s own version of Twitter, as the U.S.-based blue bird-branded microblog is blocked by the Great Firewall.

So you might think, ¡°So what? We couldn¡¯t have known to put money into these tech stocks five years ago.¡± And you would be right. But if you looked at the rising trajectory of stocks before the 2008 global financial crisis, and you were smart enough to have reinvested in lower-priced stocks at the first signs of the recovery in 2009, then you could have made off like a bandit.

In effect, the 2008 global financial crisis ended up being a kind of ¡®reset button¡¯ for stocks. It allowed for re-entry and rewards for investors willing to brave some risk. If you invested in January 2009 and held your positions until today, you would have still seen amazing growth performance: 650% for Baidu, 350% for Sina, 235% for Tencent. All in just two years.

In real money terms, if you had invested $10,000 in each of those tech stocks these figures are approximately what you could have cashed out with today: $33,000 out of Tencent, $45,000 from Sina and a whopping $75,000 out of Baidu.

Looking ahead, is it too late to invest in these companies? I asked a tech analyst at Citibank Hong Kong this question and she said it depends on your time horizon. You would need to stay in for at least two to three years. Anything less and your money might be better invested elsewhere. Share prices for Baidu, Sina and Tencent are already high and it would take that much longer to see a return on investment with which you might be happy.

As for a stock pick, she said Baidu is the safest because it¡¯s not too volatile and it¡¯s enjoyed good earnings. Relatively, Tencent is the least safe because it still has much to invest in its e-commerce division, R&D and sales and marketing. Admittedly, no one would say no to Baidu¡¯s 650% growth. But few of us would say no to Tencent¡¯s 235% growth either.

Global investors who missed out on the first tech gold rush in China appear eager to not make the same mistake again. When Chinese internet company Qihoo 360 went public on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange, shares immediately doubled on opening, according to CNNMoney. The company had priced its stock at $14.50, but soared as high as $33.40 it¡¯s first day of trade.











 In the U.S., the Internet is forcing the closure of brick and mortar stores.  In China, the web is building up entire villages.

Visit Qingyanliu in China and you quickly get a sense of how the Internet is revolutionizing the nation's job scene.

For decades, the good paying jobs have been at the factories.  Chinese workers still travel long distances to make jeans and plush toys for consumers around the world.  Others wind up in the big cities of Beijing or Shanghai trying to make ends meet.  But now people like Liu Jin can make a ton of money closer to home ¨C thanks to the web.

Liu works in Qingyanliu, a farming town that has been transformed by e-commerce.  He and some of his friends rented space in one of the squat buildings here, and armed only with a computer, they started taking and filling orders for online customers all over China.

Like many in this town, they buy goods at the nearby wholesale market of Yiwu and ship them across the country.    Millions of dollars in sales are rung up in this village every year.  Without the Internet, Liu told me, he likely would have had to move to find work.  Instead, he lives close to his parents who farm oranges nearby.  The Internet, Liu says, gives him freedom.

As China's economy develops, the government is looking for ways to even out growth and create jobs in rural areas.  The Internet is providing a solution.










As jetliners roared overhead, Wang Zhenghua led a group of employees in a round of morning tai chi in front of their office next to Shanghai's old airport.
The 67-year-old airline executive has practiced the ancient Chinese martial art for almost four decades. For this master, however, tai chi also serves as a modern-day business philosophy.
"All the tai chi moves look very gentle, but they contain a lot of inner strength -- I do the same running an airline," said Wang, founder and chairman of Spring Airlines, China's first and only low-cost carrier.
"I keep smiling even when I am frustrated by market or regulatory conditions. But inside, my determination to succeed has never wavered."
The government employee-turned-maverick businessman faced long odds when he launched Spring in the summer of 2005 with a secondhand Airbus 320 jet.
The timing was certainly right. Official statistics show the number of air passengers grew from a meager 3.4 million in 1980 to 120 million in 2004. It was a record 267 million last year, trailing only the United States.
The Chinese airline sector, however, was -- and remains -- dominated by the so-called "Big Three" state-controlled carriers. The government has the final say in almost every aspect of the industry -- from aircraft purchase and fuel price to market access and air fares.
Domestic travelers appeared hard to please, with frequent local news accounts on enraged passengers verbally or physically abusing airline personnel for perceived bad service.
But Wang had a catchy slogan -- "let the masses fly" -- and unbeatable prices. Promotional fares started so low -- at 15 U.S. cents -- that some local officials threatened to fine the carrier for "disrupting market order."
Less than six years after its maiden flight, Wang's airline has become an unlikely triumph story. With strict luggage allowance, cramped seating and no free onboard service, Spring's flights on average take off with 95 percent of the seats taken, attracting first-time fliers and road warriors alike.
"Our load factor is No. 1 in the world," Wang said proudly, adding his planes already cram in 30 percent more seats in an all economy-class configuration compared to most other airlines.
Trying to squeeze in even more passengers amid booming business, Wang grabbed global headlines in 2009 for proposing a standing-room only aircraft.
Spring's fleet has now expanded to 22 Airbus 320 aircraft. It carried 5.6 million passengers last year to 14 destinations, including bargain routes to Hong Kong and Japan.
The young carrier has boasted stellar financial performance from the first year on, even during the global economic downturn. Last year's profit topped $100 million.
"Spring shows the low-cost carrier model can be done in a heavily regulated market," said Derek Sadubin, a China specialist with Sydney-based Center for Asia Pacific Aviation. "The potential is huge for the LCC market, which is still in its infancy."
Spring stays true to its mantra by making pilots fly longer hours and turning flight attendants to onboard salespeople and cabin cleaners. But Wang says he pays top dollar to attract staff, luring experienced captains from as far away as Canada and the United States with annual salaries more than $200,000.
Sharing a small office with other executives in a nondescript building, Wang has no mobile phone or secretary. He does have a role model: Herb Kelleher, co-founder of U.S.-based Southwest Airlines, the world's pioneering budget carrier.
"Our goal is to become the next Southwest," Wang said. "We want to have 400 or 500 planes just like they do. It's really up to us to see to make it happen."
It's also up to the government to approve Spring's ambitious plans for expansion -- not always easy in an environment tilted in favor of its state-controlled rivals.
Spring is still shunned from the country's most lucrative route between Shanghai, the airline's base, and Beijing. But Wang says he keeps an open mind.
"I often tell my employees to be grateful," Wang said. "The government has already allowed us into this once-monopolized industry. If they reject an application, we just move on -- and focus on the routes they have approved by flying them well."
That sounds like another business lesson he has learned from years of practicing tai chi: You must bend to stay standing.












The Shanghai Auto Show -- the biggest automobile exhibition in the most lucrative car market in the world -- opens Tuesday amidst a flurry of China-focused global car premieres. Meanwhile, shortages in the supply chain continue to worry car manufacturers, just one month after Japan's devastating earthquake and tsunami.
Major brands including GM, Chevy, BMW, and Citroen are racing to win over Chinese customers this week, slating highly anticipated global releases for Shanghai, which this year coincides with the New York Auto Show.
European car maker PSA Peugeot Citroen hosted a flashy global unveiling of its new hatchback DS-5 in Shanghai because the company is convinced China's car market will continue growing dramatically in the coming years.
"Ten percent growth will last for several years," Peugeot's CEO Philippe Varin told reporters Monday.
The DS-5 will be produced in China by Changan Automobile, which ranks fourth in the mainland.
Also this week, Chevy will unveil its new Malibu 2013. BMW will premiere its new 6-Series luxury coupe in Shanghai, along with a concept M5 luxury sport sedan. Audi, a popular brand with a major market share in China, announced it will unveil a new Q3 crossover. Mercedes-Benz will reveal its entry-level A-Class concept car, among others.

On Monday, General Motors unveiled Baojun, its first dedicated car brand aimed specifically at Chinese consumers. The American car brand announced that it aims to more than double the number of cars it sells in China to 5 million by 2015.
"We have set some aggressive goals," GM China head Kevin Wale told reporters on Monday. "We are confident we will achieve every one of our goals."
The first model for Baojun, which means "treasured horse" in Chinese, is a mid-size 1.5-litre engine sedan that is priced between US $10,000 and $15,000, according to Wale. It is a price point that Ford hopes will be attractive to young buyers in China's second- and third-tier cities.
China's rapidly expanding car market is expected to grow even if the economy slows.
According to the Carnegie Energy and Climate Program, even if China's annual gross domestic product growth rate declines from 10 to 7 percent, as projected by the International Monetary Fund and laid out in China's 12th Five-Year Plan, some 600 million vehicles could fill China's roads by 2030.
However, the announcements across Shanghai were muted by the auto industry's continued struggle to rebound from a components shortage caused by the Japan's March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which caused forced factory closures. Short supply of crucial car parts has caused some brands, including Toyota, to temporarily half production due to shortages.
"Obviously it's a terrible tragedy for the people of Japan," Ford's China CEO Joe Hinrichs told CNN on Monday. "It's not just the supply base that directly supply the auto companies, but their suppliers and their supplies so it's a complex situation that is evolving everyday."
Ford has moved up previously planned stoppages in their manufacturing facilities to project their supply of cars in certain locations. Volvo, which is owned by China's Geely Holding Group, has been forced to look elsewhere for some parts.
"So far we have managed it very well, we had no loss of any production and no change in our model mix," Volvo CEO Stefan Jacoby told CNN. "We have some specific components where we are relying on Japan but we managed together with suppliers from Japan to find alternatives within Japan but also out of other countries and other production locations abroad."
Jacoby predicted a new wave of semiconductor shortages will emerge this summer, affecting their ability to produce gear box control units and powertrains.
As for the long term impact, auto manufacturers are cautiously optimistic.
"I think Japan quake results are going to play out over the next several months," Ford's Hinrichs said. "It's a critical time when suppliers are ramping back up and inventory levels have been coming down throughout the system, so over the next couple of months we'll know the real proof of impact of what's happening."
"I don't think there will be a major long term impact," Hinrichs told CNN.
The 14th Shanghai International Automobile Industry Exhibition opens to the media on Tuesday and to the public on Thursday.












Shunned by Western investors, economically ravaged Zimbabwe has turned its sights to the East to improve its finances.
International isolation and a bad credit record have forced Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe to seek economic support from China, the world's second-largest economy.
Since 2002, the European Union and the United States have imposed sanctions on the mineral-rich southern African country amid reports of human rights abuses, political violence and the controversial land reform policy targeting white farmers.
China has moved to occupy some of the void created by the exodus of Western businesses and now Zimbabwe's once-empty stores are filled with Chinese products.
"We are happy to have these people coming to Zimbabwe opening factories and shops, because when you compare to last time, there were more unemployed youths," says Never Jacob, a Zimbabwean store manager.
"For me, I can say (of) the coming of Chinese to Zimbabwe, we appreciate their coming," he adds.
China has been doing business with Zimbabwe for years -- Chinese foreign minister Yang Jiechi has said in the past that the two economies "are cut out for each other."

China has also called for the lifting of sanctions against Zimbabwe, saying that no country has a right to interfere in the internal affairs of another state.
And last month, it announced a $700 million-loan aimed at, among other things, rejuvenating Zimbabwe's agricultural sector.
But local economists say, overall, Chinese investments in Zimbabwe are difficult to quantify.
"Some of the projects are not easily accessible to the public and we are not given many details about how much work is done or what production has taken place," says economist John Robertson.
CNN's attempts to get figures from the Zimbabwean government about its economic partnership with China were unsuccessful.
But according to figures obtained from the Chinese embassy, the trade between the two countries totaled $560 million dollars last year -- just under half a percent of total China-Africa trade in 2010.
Chinese imports made up nearly 60% of that business, with Zimbabwe importing mainly mobile communication hardware. Its number-one export to China was, apparently, tobacco.
The Zimbabwean Minister of Investment Promotion says the Chinese are mainly interested in mineral resources, including diamonds.
Last year, Zimbabwe's efforts to improve its fragile economy seemed to be given a boost when the country was allowed to sell diamonds from its controversial Marange fields.
There are currently five companies -- two of which are Chinese -- with licenses to operate in the diamond fields near the Mozambique border.
These mines are under export controls following allegations of human rights abuses by Mugabe's Zanu-PF party. China is said to be complying with those international controls.
Zimbabwe's finance minister Tendai Biti, whose party, the Movement for Democratic Change, formed a unity government with Mugabe's party two years ago, says that diamonds have not yet provided the financial boost that many would have expected, contributing only $35 million to the country's coffers last year.
Mugabe's Zanu-PF party denies accusations of looting and abuses, while Biti blames smugglers for robbing the country of much-needed revenue.
"These diamonds are alluvial, so you can literally mine them with a spoon or the sole of your heel," says Biti.
"They are located in a place that is 66,000 hectares, so that's half the size of the United Kingdom, so what it means is that there is porousness -- anyone can virtually walk in there and pick stones," he adds.
China has been silent on the issue, choosing rather stick to its policy of non-interference in the internal matters of other countries.











 Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard on Wednesday concluded her two-day visit to Beijing aimed at broadening relations between the two nations.
Gillard met with President Hu Jintao on Wednesday morning.
She also joined her Chinese counterpart Wen Jiabao for a closed-door bilateral meeting.
Chinese Vice Premier Li Keqiang expressed hope for a broader relationship between the two.
"The two countries should seek a long-term stable and strategic cooperation in energy and resources, rather than maintain a simple buyer-seller relationship," Li said late Tuesday at an economic and trade forum, according to Chinese state media.
Li said the two nations can benefit from each other, according to Xinhua news agency.
"There is room for the two countries to work together in this sector as Australia is vigorously boosting infrastructure construction while Chinese businesses have expertise and advanced technologies," Li said.
Gillard said she discussed human rights issues with Wen.
"I raised our concerns about human rights, ethnic minorities, religious freedom and in relation to the treatment of human rights activists," Gillard told reporters later during a news conference.
"Premier Wen did listen to the concerns that I raised," Gillard said. "He did indicate his view is China has not taken a backward step on human rights."
When asked if she was satisfied with Wen's response, Gillard replied, "What we do is raise our concerns and I've done that very clearly with Premier Wen."
Gillard's cautious approach to China's human rights record reflects the reality that it is Australia's largest trading partner, overtaking Japan in 2009. China currently purchases more than one-quarter of Australia's exports.
"People are hungry for our commodities exports, they're hungry for our energy exports so I'm very confident these export industries have a very bright future," Gillard said.
Gillard also took a private tour of the Forbidden City with partner Tim Mathieson.

Drinking water is in short supply in parts of eastern China where a months-long drought has reservoirs tapped, state-run media reported.
More than 230,000 people -- mostly in rural areas of Jiangxi Province -- are bearing the brunt of the water shortage, the provincial flood control and drought relief headquarters said Tuesday.
For the first four months of 2011, the province has received about half its normal rainfall, the agency said.








Watching local customers savor chicken curry and sip mango lassi during lunchtime at his Pakistani restaurant, Mughal's, in the trendy Sanlitun neighborhood of Beijing, owner Aasif Jaleel reflects on the deep ties between China and his homeland beyond the culinary bond.
"I have been traveling to really small and remote places in China," said the 43-year-old Islamabad native who has lived in the Chinese capital for a decade. "When people hear you're from Pakistan, they always mention that Pakistan is a lao pengyou -- an old friend."
As the two countries prepare to mark the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations Saturday, Pakistani leaders certainly share such warm feelings toward China, especially in light of the strained Washington-Islamabad ties after the recent killing of Osama bin Laden by U.S. special forces inside Pakistan.
Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao last year called Sino-Pakistani ties "firm as a rock," and his Pakistani counterpart echoed the sentiment Monday.
"To test a friend whether true or not, it needs time and means under crisis," Pakistani Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani told China's state-run media before leaving for a four-day official visit to China, during which he is scheduled to meet Wen and Chinese President Hu Jintao.
"We appreciate that in all difficult circumstances China stood with Pakistan -- therefore we call China a true friend and a time-tested and all-weather friend."

Although Gilani's trip was planned long before bin Laden's death, some observers see his comments as a jab to the United States and expect him to further strengthen ties with China to counter mounting U.S. criticisms. While many Americans suspect Pakistan of covertly harboring bin Laden, China has been quick to defend its ally.
"The Pakistani government is firm in resolve and strong in action when it comes to counterterrorism -- and has made important contributions to the international counterterrorism efforts," Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Jiang Yu said the day after the killing of the al Qaeda leader.
She called it "absurd" that Pakistan would reportedly allow China to examine the wreckage of a U.S. stealth helicopter that crashed in the raid on the bin Laden hideout.
But military relations have been close since Pakistan became one of the first countries to recognize the Communist government on the Chinese mainland. Sharing Islamabad's strategic concern over India, China has long been the main arms supplier to Pakistan.
China has helped Pakistan build its main nuclear power plant, despite Washington's unease over the safety of nuclear materials in a violence-prone country with Islamic militancy running strong. Some analysts believe Beijing also supported Islamabad's nuclear weapons program.
"Pakistan plays a major role in bridging China to the Muslim world," Teng Jimeng, a professor of American studies at Beijing Foreign Studies University, explained the special relationship between the two countries.
"As China continues to rise economically, it is searching for more natural resources," he added. "Pakistan could provide another route to ship oil and other resources into China."
China's fast-growing trade ties with Pakistan's archrival, India, however, show the limits of the Sino-Pakistani relationship. The Beijing leadership's increasing wariness over Muslim militants -- many with strong links to Pakistan -- in China's restive far western Xinjiang region could also put the all-weather friendship to the test.
Back in the popular Pakistani restaurant in Beijing, owner Jaleel sees diminishing U.S. influence in his country almost as a foregone conclusion.
"Americans invested a lot of money in Pakistan, but it was not invested in the right direction or in the right areas," said the businessman who started his career with IBM in Pakistan and later opened Beijing's first Subway sandwich shop. "The money mostly was invested in the war -- and the common people don't see the benefits."
Jaleel feels happy to see the rise of a longtime Pakistani ally who has stood by his nation through thick and thin.
"Wars, floods, earthquakes -- whatever the situation China has always been very friendly to Pakistan and has always supported Pakistan," he said. "I feel the stronger China is, the more helpful it will be for Pakistan."











 Japan, China, and South Korea agreed Sunday to increase cooperation on nuclear safety as Japan works to end a crisis at its Fukushima Daiichi power plant.
At a trilateral summit in Tokyo, leaders of the three nations issued a joint declaration vowing to help each other, "especially at times of disaster and adversity."
The declaration added that Japan expressed its determination to resolve the nuclear crisis sparked by the March 11 earthquake and resulting tsunami.
Japanese Prime Minister Naoto Kan, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao and South Korean President Lee Myung-bak took part in the meeting.
The leaders called nuclear power ''an important option for many countries,'' but noted that ensuring its safety is ''a prerequisite," Japan's Kyodo news agency reported.
They also "agreed to facilitate joint programs on renewable energy and energy conservation to avoid excessive dependence on nuclear power," the Kyodo report said.
China's state-run Xinhua news agency said the three "agreed in their talks to promote dialogues and cooperation concerning food safety and energy security." And they "vowed to make efforts to reach a substantial consensus on the negotiation of a trilateral investment agreement and accelerate a joint study on a free trade agreement."











North Korean leader Kim Jong Il was visiting China on Friday, a South Korean official said, according to state-run Yonhap news agency.
The report contradicts earlier ones that Kim's son and heir apparent, Kim Jong Un, was leading the visit. It was unclear whether his son was accompanying him.
According to Yonhap, the trip would be Kim Jong Il's third to China in a little over a year.
The news follows last week's revelation that South Korean President Lee Myung-bak has officially invited Kim Jong Il to attend a nuclear security summit in Seoul next year.
South Koreans pay close attention to the movements of the leadership of North Korea, perhaps the world's most secretive regime. North Korean state media is often slow in reporting the Kims' activities.
Open Radio for North Korea, a South Korean non-governmental organization, said Kim was visiting China. The organization is partly staffed by defectors from the North. It maintains a network of informants in North Korea.
"I checked through my sources, and one had heard from a military officer working at the border yesterday that there was some kind of 'emergency' along the border," said Ha Tae-kyung, the organization's president. "According to that military officer, it was Kim Jong Il who is going -- not his son."
His account and the South Korean news agency report could not be independently verified.
The term of Chinese President Hu Jintao's term is set to expire next year, prompting some to anticipate greater diplomatic interchange between Beijing and Pyongyang as Kim seeks to forge relations with the incoming leader.
It's clear that North Korea needs help, analysts said.
"Kim Jong Il wants to get something from South Korea or the U.S. or China -- economic aid or security assurances -- but at the moment he is not getting anything and China is preventing North Korea from further provocations," said Choi Jin-wook of Seoul's Korea Institute of National Unification. "Kim wants to know what China is going to do for them."
Heavily sanctioned following several nuclear and missile tests, Pyongyang has been reaching out to South Korea in recent months -- experts say the hardline state is desperate for a resumption of food aid.
However, its customary form of leverage -- provocations -- is being restrained by Beijing, And six-party talks, which would offer economic incentives in return for North Korean denuclearization, have been in limbo for more than two years.
Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who visited Pyongyang and Seoul last month, carried a message from Kim to South Korea's Lee, in which the North Korean leader said he was ready to meet with the South's president "without preconditions."
Seoul's policy is to refuse high-level contacts until North Korea apologizes for two incidents last year that killed 50 South Koreans. South Korea accuses the North of torpedoing and sinking one of its warships in March 2010, killing 46 sailors. In November, North Korea shelled Yeonpyeong Island, killing two South Korean marines and two civilians.
Last week, however, Lee invited Kim to visit South Korea.
"The South Korean government did deliver a message of our invitation to North Korea's leader to visit next year's Nuclear Security Summit in Seoul," the foreign press officer from the presidential office said.
Few, however, expect Kim -- a virtual recluse whose political decisions are made behind closed doors and who is reportedly paranoid about personal security -- to engage in such high-profile, transparent statesmanship as an international nuclear summit, or to visit Seoul.
The last two inter-Korean presidential summits took place in Pyongyang.














 In a rare admission, the Chinese government has said the Three Gorges Dam -- the world's largest hydropower plant -- is having "urgent problems," warning of environmental, construction and migration "disasters" amid the worst drought to hit southern China in 50 years.
China's State Council, the country's Cabinet, this week said that while the dam has been beneficial to the region, there has also been a variety of issues since construction began in 1992.
"At the same time that the Three Gorges Dam project provides huge comprehensive benefits, urgent problems must be resolved regarding the smooth relocation of residents, ecological protection and geological disaster prevention," the statement said.
This is the first major official acknowledgment of the dam's repercussions. The Chinese government also admitted the Three Gorges Dam has negatively impacted downstream river water, transport and migration.
"Some problems emerged at various stages of project planning and construction but could not be solved immediately due to the conditions at the time," the State Council said. "Some arose because of increased demands brought on by economic and social development."
The project, which cost more than 180 billion yuan (US$28 billion), has been a source of pride for the government while also arousing intense debate among scientists and villagers. Completed in 2006, the dam includes a five-tier ship lock, a reservoir, and 26 hydropower turbo-generators. The dam was originally touted for its ability to control the impact of flooding that threatens the Yangtze river delta each summer.

However, millions of Chinese citizens have been adversely impacted throughout the construction process and even after the dam's completion.
The Three Gorges displaced over 1.4 million residents along the Yangtze during the digging and construction of a giant concrete barrier, made up of 16 million tons of concrete. More than 1,000 towns and villages were flooded in the process. Landslides and pollution have plagued the areas near the dam since it was built.
Meanwhile, a prolonged drought has persisted along the Yangtze, affecting nearly 10 million people along the river's middle and lower sections, in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi and Anhui provinces, according to the official Xinhua news agency.
Citizens in the region are blaming the dam's restiction on river flow for exacerbating the effects of the drought.
These regions will mostly see hot and dry weather during the coming week, the China Meteorological Administration warned.
Meteorological data also indicated that rainfall in drought-affected regions was down 30% to 80% compared to levels in normal years, while the provinces of Anhui, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, and the city of Shanghai continue suffering from the worst drought since 1954, Xinhua reported.
Provincial and local departments have been instructed to activate cloud-seeding to induce rainfall if necessary.
The government has ordered 5 billion cubic meters of water to be discharged from the Three Gorges Dam over the next 20 days to ease the effects of the drought. But officials say the order, which follows the release of 1.86 billion cubic meters of water in the first two weeks of May, will have a limited impact on fighting drought conditions.
"All the discharged water can only reach areas along the Jingjiang section of the Yangtze River, meaning the drought situation in three places in the central part in Hubei... will be relieved to some degree," said Wang Jingquan, a senior official of the flood control and drought relief office affiliated to the Yangtze River Water Resources Committee.
"The far lower reach of the river can only get very limited benefits," he said as reported in the state-run China Daily.
"With the current observation devices and data, we have found no evidence that the drought was caused by the dam," Liu Min, a meteorological specialist with the Hubei Provincial Weather Bureau, told Xinhua.













Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao has met in Beijing with Kim Jong Il, the reclusive leader of North Korea, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Thursday.
Kim was widely reported to have been in China, but both countries declined to formally confirm the visit -- even after grainy photos surfaced on websites that appeared to show Kim in China, North Korea's closest ally.
Kim was on his third China visit since last May, the news agency reported. It quoted him as saying that China and North Korea have made "extensive achievements in their trade cooperation in recent years" and that they "took a significant step forward in building a new cross-border bridge over the Yalu River."
Wen said "it is a steadfast principle" of the Chinese government "to consolidate and develop" a friendship between China and North Korea, the Xinhua report said. The news report added that "both sides boosted substantial cooperation in trade and other areas, which have helped promote economic development and improve people's lives in the two countries."
Kim noted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of a friendship and cooperation treaty between North Korea and China, Xinhua reported. He also called on both nations to expand cooperation to "usher in a new era of full-flourish trade cooperation," the news agency said.
South Korean and Japanese media, whose journalists usually doggedly follow the North Korean ruler on such trips, had reported that Kim's special train crossed the border into China Friday. They said the leader started his journey with several stops in the northeast, including a tour at one of the China's biggest automakers.
China usually confirms North Korean officials' visits only after they have returned home.
With heavy sanctions still in place on North Korea after its nuclear and missile tests, analysts have said that the communist nation clearly needs help, especially in light of recent reports that an unusually harsh weather has ruined its winter crops.
"Kim Jong Il wants to get something from South Korea or the U.S. or China -- economic aid or security assurances -- but at the moment he is not getting anything, and China is preventing North Korea from further provocations," Choi Jin-wook of Seoul's Korea Institute of National Unification has said. "Kim wants to know what China is going to do for them."
As a U.S. government delegation traveled Tuesday to North Korea for a four-day trip to assess the food situation, China remained largely quiet on how it would respond to its isolated neighbor's aid requests.
"Over the years China, within its means, has provided some assistance to (North Korea) aimed at helping it improve its people's livelihood and developing its economy," said Jiang Yu, a spokeswoman for China's foreign ministry. "We support international aid projects" in the North.
















 The death toll rose to three Friday following a series of explosions a day earlier at government facilities in the eastern Chinese city of Fuzhou, local officials told CNN.
"One body was found at one of the blast sites and two people died in the hospital," said Zhang Baoyun, a spokesman for the government of Jiangxi province, where Fuzhou is located. Five people were wounded in the blasts, he said.
Among the dead was the man suspected of setting off the explosives, Zhang said. He was identified as Qian Mingpi, 52, an unemployed resident of the area, he said.
Zhang declined to confirm an earlier Xinhua news agency report that blamed a disgruntled local peasant farmer for setting off the bombs because of an ongoing lawsuit.
The bombings began Thursday morning with a car bomb exploding in the parking lot of the Fuzhou city prosecutor's office. A blast at the Linchuan district government building followed and then another at the local drug administration building, Zhang said.
Fuzhou is a city of nearly 4 million residents some 1,600 kilometers (994 miles) south of Beijing.
In September, clashes between residents and officials in Yihuang, a county under Fuzhou, gained national attention when three residents doused themselves with gasoline and burned themselves to protest the forced demolition of their home by the local government.
One died in the hospital, prompting widespread outrage that eventually forced provincial authorities to fire several local officials.













Kim Jong Il, the reclusive leader of North Korea, is advocating that six-party talks aimed at dismantling the country's nuclear program resume, China's state-run Xinhua news agency reported Friday.
The comments by Kim came during talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao, the news agency said.
Kim, according to Xinhua, said he hopes to ease tension on the Korean peninsula and resume talks "at an early date." He also said he hopes his country's relations with South Korea can be improved, the news agency reported.
It's one of the first public comments by Kim since former U.S. President Jimmy Carter said last month that the North Korean leader indicated he wanted to resume the so-called six-party talks. The talks ended in 2009 when North Korea walked away from negotiations over its nuclear program.
Xinhua's report came the same day North Korea's state media confirmed Kim had returned from an "unofficial visit" to China, its closest ally and largest trading partner.

Kim was widely reported to have been in China, but both countries declined to formally confirm the visit until now -- even after photos surfaced on websites that appeared to show Kim meeting with Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao.
North Korea's state media also released excerpts of a speech that indicated Kim attended a banquet with Wen and Hu where he thanked the Chinese government for its support.
"We are also satisfied with a good strategic understanding between our two parties and two countries, and with the proper implementation of agreements reached between us and the collective leadership of (China) in the political, economic, cultural and all other fields," Kim said, according to North Korean state media.
The excerpts released by North Korea did not reflect Kim's comments as reported by Xinhua. It was unclear when the speech was delivered.
Kim was on his third China visit since last May, the news agency reported. It quoted him as saying that China and North Korea have made "extensive achievements in their trade cooperation in recent years."
With heavy sanctions still in place on North Korea after its nuclear and missile tests, analysts have said that the communist nation clearly needs help, especially in light of recent reports that an unusually harsh weather has ruined its winter crops.
As a U.S. government delegation traveled Tuesday to North Korea for a four-day trip to assess the food situation, China remained quiet on how it would respond to its isolated neighbor's aid requests.
The U.S. suspended aid two years ago to North Korea because it suspected donated food was being diverted to the military or not reaching those most in need.
Washington and Pyongyang have no diplomatic relations, and North and South Korea have no formal ties and remain technically in a state of war since a 1953 truce that ended the Korean War.










An official in Inner Mongolia is disputing an Amnesty International report that parts of the region are under martial law.
"We did not enforce martial law. Everything is normal," said Chao Lumen, an official with the information department of Xilingol prefecture.
In the report released Friday, Amnesty International detailed protests in and around the city of Xilinhot, the prefecture's seat of government.
"Nothing happened here. There were no demonstrations or protests," Chao said Monday.
The Amnesty report said Chinese authorities declared martial law in some parts of the autonomous region in an apparent response to days of protests.
The region has long been the scene of ethnic tension between Mongolians, who have lived in the area for centuries, and the Han people, who arrived in larger numbers after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. Han people are the majority ethnic group in China.
According to the human rights organization, 2,000 Mongolian students took to the streets Wednesday in Xilinhot, in a show of solidarity with an ethnic Mongolian herder by the name of "Mergen," who was killed earlier this month when he was hit by a coal truck that was driven by ethnic Hans.
Amnesty reported that the drivers of the coal truck are both in custody of Chinese authorities.
In a clip posted to YouTube that purports to show that same demonstration, a large group of people, many of whom are young people wearing school uniforms, can be seen walking through the streets.
The students were marching toward the building that houses the regional government, shouting, "defend our land and defend our rights, according to the New York-based Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center. The group refers to the area as "southern" -- not "inner" -- Mongolia, and would like to see the region achieve independence or merge with Mongolia.
CNN could not independently verify the authenticity of the clip.
According to Amnesty, the protests, which started May 23, have been largely peaceful, but at least 18 people were reported injured in confrontations with police northeast of Xilinhot, in Right Ujimchin Banner, or Xi Wu Qi in Mandarin.
"The protests are a wake-up call for the authorities. As in other minority areas, authorities must start heeding the message rather than attacking the messengers," said Catherine Baber, Amnesty's Asia pacific deputy director.
Protesters say their culture is under threat as pastoral herders are pushed out from the grasslands and forced to move to the cities, or to places where animal grazing is not possible, according to Enghebatu Togochog, Director of the Southern Mongolian Human Rights Information Center.
He traces the motivation for recent demonstrations to the Chinese central government's efforts, in recent years, to expand coal mining and production in areas that have traditionally been used for grazing.











Clashes between Serbian police and protesters broke out Sunday in Belgrade after an ultranationalist party demonstrated against the arrest of genocide suspect Ratko Mladic.
Nearly 20 people were injured in the violence -- seven police and 12 civilians -- according to police. They said they made more than 100 arrests.
Mladic, wanted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in connection with the 1995 Srebrenica massacre, was captured Thursday after nearly 16 years in hiding.
The Serbian Radical Party held its protest Sunday in front of Serbia's parliament building.
Despite calls for calm from the event's organizers, demonstrators on the fringes of the rally threw rocks at police.
Hundreds of officers, some in riot gear and others on horseback, moved in against the crowd. Some beat and kicked protesters. Police stayed on the streets as the demonstrators scattered.

"We are gathered here to peacefully protest the betrayal by (Serbian President) Boris Tadic and his bosses in Brussels," party leaders told the crowd before the clashes erupted. "We have had enough economic humiliation by our enemies, who are destroying our country ... in every way."
At the protest -- which was attended by members of Mladic's family and thousands of others -- speakers demanded that Tadic step down and asked that elections be held immediately.
Mladic's son, Darko, told the crowd that his father is sick. "He needs medical treatment that he is not getting," the younger Mladic said.
He described his father as "a freedom fighter," and said he had "defended his own nation, defended his people, which was his job."
The younger Mladic called on protesters to keep their demonstration peaceful. "Tomorrow if I'm able to visit my father, I will tell him of this and he will cry again," he said.
Mladic gave himself up without a fight, despite having two handguns, according to Rasim Ljajic, the government minister in charge of searching for fugitive suspected war criminals.
Officials located Mladic in a village called Lazarevo, north of the Serbian capital, after culling information from his former comrades, those who supported him financially and his close family members, Ljajic said.
It is not clear what source led investigators to the former military commander, accused of ordering the 1995 massacre of some 8,000 Muslims in the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica.
His arrest clears a major hurdle that once stood between Serbia and its long-awaited entrance into the European Union, but the move could also usher in political backlash from the country's electorate, some of whom consider Mladic a hero.
"We're conscious of this danger," Ljajic told CNN Saturday. "We know we did something that didn't bring us joy or applause from the public. But we also know that we took great responsibility and did something that the political elite of any country is supposed to do."
He called Mladic's capture "a political investment," noting the government's desire to bring the war crimes suspect to justice "even if citizens punish us in the next elections."
The massacre at Srebrenica, which sparked international outcry and preceded a NATO bombing campaign, is now remembered as the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II.
Mladic allegedly presided over the five-day slaughter in July where Muslim men and boys were systematically executed in what was described at the U.N. war crimes tribunal as "the triumph of evil."
Mladic's forces encircled the town, a U.N.-declared "safe area" where thousands of Bosnian Muslims had sought refuge, allegedly conducting wholesale slaughter and rape, despite the presence of a few hundred lightly armed Dutch U.N. peacekeepers charged with protecting the area's residents and its refugees.
The former general is considered the last of the fugitive war criminal suspects in the region, following the capture of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who died in jail in 2006 during his trial at The Hague.
At the rally Sunday, a defiant Darko Mladic told the crowd, "We will never accept those who bombed us to write our history. For centuries we have been fighting for our own state, for our own country to give us security. We don't allow illiterate Westerners to write our history."
A medical team has determined that Mladic is healthy enough to be extradited to face a war crimes tribunal, a court spokeswoman in Belgrade said Friday.
While the war crimes suspect suffers from several chronic conditions, the team said there are no immediate problems barring a move.
This comes after five doctors examined Mladic Thursday night, according to the ex-general's lawyer, Milos Saljic.













Voters in the overwhelmingly Catholic country of Malta have elected to allow divorce, the prime minister said.
Initial results of a weekend referendum suggest the measure will pass with some 54% of votes in support of the introduction of divorce.
Though counting continues, analysts predict the vote will carry and Maltese Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi -- who opposed the measure -- has conceded.
"Even though the result is not what I wished for, now it is our duty to see that the will of the majority is respected," Gonzi said.
The Mediterranean island nation of Malta is one of the only countries in the world that does not permit divorce. About 98% of Maltese residents are Catholic.
Gonzi said the parliament is now expected to enact legislation that will make divorce legal.

 Germany's ruling coalition has agreed to shut down all of the nation's nuclear power plants by 2022.
Minister of Ecology Norbert Roettgen of the Christian Democratic Union party made the announcement early Monday after negotiations with coalition partner, the Liberal Party, which had been opposed to setting a date for decommissioning the nuclear facilities.
Opposition parties have long supported shuttering nuclear energy in Germany
"The decision looks like this," Roettgen said. "Seven older nuclear power plants ... and the nuclear plant Kruemmel will not go back online ... a second group of six nuclear reactors will go offline at the end of 2021 at the latest, and ... the three most modern, newest nuclear plants will go offline in 2022 at the latest."
To make up for the loss of nuclear energy, the German government will begin to switch to renewable energy and increase investments in energy research, the government website says.
"But we will not be able to do without conventional power plants, above all cutting-edge gas power plants for a long time," said a statement published last week. "New fruits of new research should contribute to making the energy transition more efficient and easier on the ecology."
In March, German Chancellor Angela Merkel announced she would rethink a plan to extend the lifespan of her country's nuclear power plants.
"The events in Japan have shown us that even things that seem all but impossible scientifically can in fact happen," Merkel said at a Berlin news conference.
Japan's Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant was damaged in a March 11 earthquake and tsunami, which has spewed large amounts of radiation into the environment.
At the time, Merkel ordered a review of the nuclear plant safety standards, saying there would be "no taboos in those reviews."















Ratko Mladic's lawyer has requested a new medical examination for the former Bosnian Serb general, arguing that Mladic is not healthy enough to face charges of genocide at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, he said Monday.
Mladic would not be able to participate in a trial because of his ill health, lawyer Milos Saljic said.
He wants Mladic examined by specialists "who can investigate his specific needs," including a gastroenterologist, cardiologist, psychiatrist and neurologist.
Mladic, 69, is wanted in connection with the massacre of nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995. He was captured Thursday after more than 15 years in hiding.
His lawyer expects the Serbian court's response by Tuesday, he said. The court has already ruled Mladic is fit to stand trial.

Saljic also plans to file a formal appeal against extradition, he said, adding that it would put it in the mail by noon (6 a.m. ET) Monday.
And he is applying for Mladic's unpaid pension from the years when he was in hiding, he said, saying he was acting on behalf of Mladic's family.
Chief prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic denied Monday that Mladic was in poor health, saying that he was "lively and joking," and had asked for Russian classics to read. He said Mladic would be sent to The Hague within days if his extradition appeal fails.
Mladic's son, Darko, told an ultranationalist rally Sunday that that his father is sick.

Mladic gave himself up without a fight, despite having two handguns, according to Rasim Ljajic, the government minister in charge of searching for fugitive suspected war criminals.
Officials located Mladic in a village called Lazarevo, north of the Serbian capital, after culling information from his former comrades, those who supported him financially and his close family members, Ljajic said.
It is not clear what source led investigators to the former military commander.
His arrest clears a major hurdle that once stood between Serbia and its long-awaited entrance into the European Union, but the move could also usher in political backlash from the country's electorate, some of whom consider Mladic a hero.
"We're conscious of this danger," Ljajic told CNN Saturday. "We know we did something that didn't bring us joy or applause from the public. But we also know that we took great responsibility and did something that the political elite of any country is supposed to do."
He called Mladic's capture "a political investment," noting the government's desire to bring the war crimes suspect to justice "even if citizens punish us in the next elections."
The massacre at Srebrenica, which sparked international outcry and preceded a NATO bombing campaign, is now remembered as the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II.
Mladic allegedly presided over the five-day slaughter in July where Muslim men and boys were systematically executed in what was described at the U.N. war crimes tribunal as "the triumph of evil."
Mladic's forces encircled the town, a U.N.-declared "safe area" where thousands of Bosnian Muslims had sought refuge, allegedly conducting wholesale slaughter and rape, despite the presence of a few hundred lightly armed Dutch U.N. peacekeepers charged with protecting the area's residents and its refugees.
The former general is considered the last of the fugitive war criminal suspects in the region, following the capture of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who died in jail in 2006 during his trial at The Hague.
At the rally Sunday, a defiant Darko Mladic told the crowd, "We will never accept those who bombed us to write our history. For centuries we have been fighting for our own state, for our own country to give us security. We don't allow illiterate Westerners to write our history."
A medical team has determined that Mladic is healthy enough to be extradited to face a war crimes tribunal, a court spokeswoman in Belgrade said Friday.
While the war crimes suspect suffers from several chronic conditions, the team said there are no immediate problems barring a move.
This comes after five doctors examined Mladic Thursday night, according to Saljic, the lawyer.














Spain's National Court issued an arrest warrant Monday for 20 Salvadoran military officials in connection with the slayings of six priests, their housekeeper and her daughter more than two decades ago.
The event, known as the "Jesuit Massacre," became one of the most notorious episodes of El Salvador's bloody 12-year civil war, which pitted leftist guerrillas against the U.S.-backed conservative government.
In an indictment issued Monday, Judge Eloy Velasco Nunez accused the officials -- including El Salvador's former defense minister -- of murder, terrorism and crimes against humanity. He said a trial in El Salvador was flawed and failed to bring the perpetrators to justice.
"That judicial process was a defective and widely criticized process that ended with two forced convictions and acquittals even of confessed killers," Velasco wrote.
Two military officers were convicted of murder in 1991, but were pardoned in 1993 under an amnesty law approved by El Salvador's National Assembly.
The eight victims of the November 1989 killings "were one of at least 75,000 unarmed civilians who died in this war, which was much more violent than the better known conflicts in Chile and Argentina," Velasco wrote. "It is estimated that 85% of the deaths can be attributed to the army and security forces."
Five of the slain Jesuits were born in Spain. They were killed at their residence at prestigious Central American University in El Salvador's capital, San Salvador.
The case was taken to Spain's National Court because of its involvement in other high-profile human rights cases.
The same Spanish court issued an arrest warrant for former Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet in 1998, while he was in a London hospital. The former dictator was held in England for 18 months while officials considered Spain's extradition request. British authorities ultimately decided Pinochet was too frail to stand trial, and allowed him to go home to Chile.
The Spanish court has also taken on human rights cases from other countries, testing an international legal principle known as universal jurisdiction that allows some serious crimes to be tried anywhere, regardless of where the alleged offenses occurred.
Spain and El Salvador have an extradition treaty, opening up the possibility that the Central American country could send the former officials to Madrid to stand trial.
For years, the extreme right in El Salvador had accused the Jesuits of siding with the leftist guerrillas. Uniformed troops were seen searching the living quarters of the priests at Central American University two days before the killings, CNN reported at the time.
One of the slain Jesuits spoke to CNN shortly before he was killed about the chilling effect of the long-running Salvadoran civil war.
"We have become used to violence," Ignacio Martin Baro said. "We have become used to living in a very dangerous world. We have learned to live, accepting death, extraordinary abnormal death, into our lives."













The "pig" above is running the Gothenburg Half Marathon in Gothenburg, Sweden.
The race, known as G?teborgsvarvet in Sweden, took place May 21 and is one of the most popular half marathons in the world. More than 59,000 runners signed up to compete in the race, which has been held every year since 1980.
This year's winners were a couple of Kenyans: Albert Kiplagat Matebor finished first on the men's side with a time of 1 hour, 52 seconds, and Joyce Chepkirui finished first for the women at 1 hour, 9 minutes and 4 seconds. Sorry, I have no idea where the pig finished or if the pig finished at all.
Gothenburg, a seaport on Sweden's southwestern coast, is the country's second-largest city behind capital city Stockholm. According to the race website, Gothenburg "offers the charm of a small town and the opportunities of a big city with museums, a fantastic amusement park, good food and a lot of different activities."
The only person to correctly answer this week's photo challenge was "TheStreak," who added that "elaborate costumes have become quite common" for the race.

An E. coli outbreak linked to some raw vegetables has killed at least six people and sickened hundreds in Germany, national and global health authorities said Monday.
The first investigation results released by the German federal unit responsible for disease control and prevention -- the Robert Koch Institute, under Germany's Ministry of Health -- indicated that the most recent infections were likely caused by consuming raw tomatoes, cucumbers and lettuce.
The agency said it is advising consumers to avoid eating those foods, specifically in northern Germany.
The institute is investigating six deaths, according to the World Health Organization. Three of those fatalities, all adults, were caused by hemolytic-uremic syndrome, or HUS, from E. coli. The other three fatalities -- all of them elderly -- were caused by an infection linked to HUS and E. coli, said Dr. Guenael Rodier of the World Health Organization.
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said 329 cases of HUS have been reported since May 2. Though HUS is normally seen in children younger than 5, the vast majority of the current outbreak's cases are adults, and more than two-thirds are women, the center said Monday on its website.

"The source of the outbreak is under investigation, but contaminated food seems the most likely vehicle of infection," it said.
Most of the patients are from, or have been to, northern Germany, primarily Hamburg, Northern Lower Saxony and Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, it said.
Cases have been reported in Sweden, the United Kingdom, Netherlands and Denmark among people who have visited Germany, most of them northern Germany, it said.
The European Food Safety Alert Network said EHEC, or enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli, a strain of E. coli that causes hemorrhage in the intestines, was found in organic cucumbers originating from Spain, packaged in Germany, and distributed to countries including Austria, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Hungary, Luxembourg and Spain.
The Spanish Agency for Food Safety and Nutrition issued a statement saying that two Spanish companies producing cucumbers may be involved in the outbreak, and the agency is awaiting further results from Germany's investigation.
"This is the eye of the storm," said Oliver Grieve, a spokesman for the University Medical Centre Schleswig-Holstein, where one of the deaths occurred. "We're working 24 hours here, and we're getting patients from all over northern Germany including Hamburg."
As of Monday, 115 patients were infected with EHEC -- 68 in the medical center's Kiel campus and 47 in its Lubeck campus. Eighty-two patients were stricken by HUS -- 42 in Kiel and 40 in Lubeck, he said.
The fatality, an 86-year-old woman, died of HUS; her husband remains hospitalized with EHEC, Grieve said.
"Patients are coming in waves," he added.
Cases of bloody diarrhea associated with HUS were first reported in Germany in the second week of May. The detection of E. coli on cucumbers was first reported on May 26.
Germany's Federal Ministry of Food, Agriculture and Consumer Protection advised consumers to cook their food to a minimum temperature of 70 degrees Celsius (about 160 degrees Fahrenheit) for at least two minutes to kill any E. coli bacteria. Freezing food does not kill bacteria reliably, the ministry added.
Russia said Monday it is suspending all imports of vegetables, including tomatoes, cucumbers and salad leaves, produced in Germany and Spain.
The Russian Federal Agency for Health and Consumer Rights, Rospotrebnadzor, said on its website that it has not received information from the European Union on the causes of the infection and the measures taken to "localize and eliminate the outbreak."
"A decision might be taken in the next few hours regarding the ban on imports and sales of vegetables in Russia from all EU countries," the agency said.












Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's ruling coalition has suffered a major defeat in local elections in Milan and Naples, with voters backing left-wing candidates in both cities.
Milan's turn to the left is a powerful setback for Berlusconi. Milan is his hometown and his political stronghold, and it has been led by a center-right mayor for the past two decades
In Milan, official voting results issued Monday by the Italian Interior Ministry gave the left-wing candidate, Giuliano Pisapia, about 55% of the vote over the incumbent mayor and center-right candidate Letizia Moratti, who had nearly 45% in Sunday's balloting. In Naples the left-wing candidate, Lugi De Magistris, was winning with 65% of the vote against the 34% of the center-right candidate, Gianni Lettieri. Whichever candidate winds up with more than 51% wins becomes the new major.
Supporters of leading candidates in both Milan and Naples began celebrating their apparent victories even before the final official voting count was over.
Political analysts have said that these local elections were a referendum on the Italian premier, who has been battling to hold his coalition together over the past six months as he fought various corruption trials, as well as a current trial in which he faces charges of abuse of power and prostitution with an underage teenager. That trial resumes tomorrow in Milan.
The voting was the second round of the process. The shock, many say, came two weeks ago, May 14 and 15, when the first ballot round took place and it became clear that his hometown had been lost or was at serious risk.
The Italian premier was on a two-day visit to Romania on Monday and had not released any comments on the election results, But many of his party members, including a minister, have said that this is a time for reflection.
An editorial in Italian leading newspaper,Corriere della Sera, Monday summed it up:
"The premier has already faced the worst-case scenario. His party looses in Milan and in Naples. A double blow with strong political consequences, both real and of the country's image. Is he worried? They (his political aides) assure us NO. or at least, no more. ....his mind is already in tomorrow."













A jury in Copenhagen City Court on Monday found 25-year-old Chechen Lors Doukaev guilty of attempted terrorism, the court announced.
According to the court documents Lors Doukaev intended to send a letter bomb to Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten but accidentally set off the bomb material in Copenhagen Hotel Jorgensen where he was staying last September.
The blast destroyed the bathroom and injured Doukaev, who ran into a nearby park. Police surrounded him in the park and the bomb squad detonated a pouch he was wearing.
In addition to the conviction for attempted terrorism, he was also found guilty of carrying a pistol. He could be sentenced to up to 16 years in prison. Sentencing will be Tuesday.
Doukaev traveled to Denmark on September 7 under false name and booked a room on Hotel Jorgensen under a false name. He said in court that he had a pistol and a bomb for personal security reasons
Jyllands-Posten triggered global protests and controversy in 2005 when it published 12 drawings of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed. The controversy grew in early 2006 when a Norwegian newspaper reprinted the drawings. Islamic law generally bans any depiction of Mohammed.











Carbon emissions from energy use reached a record level last year, up 5% from the previous record in 2008, the International Energy Agency said.
The Paris-based agency called the findings a "serious setback" to limit global temperature increase to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 F), which was set at the U.N. climate change talks in Cancun, Mexico, last year.
"Our latest estimates are another wake-up call," said Fatih Birol, chief economist at the IEA. "The world has edged incredibly close to the level of emissions that should not be reached until 2020 ... it will be extremely challenging to succeed in achieving this global goal agreed in Cancun."
Carbon emissions climbed to a record 30.6 gigatonnes in 2010. For the 2-degree goal to remain attainable, emissions in 2020 can't be greater than 32 gigatonnes.
And for that to happen, carbon dioxide emissions over the next 10 years has to rise less than they did between 2009 and 2010, the agency says.

But some scientists think the 2-degree goal is overly optimistic, suggesting a 4-degree increase is likely during the 21st century.
In an issue of the British journal "Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A" -- scientists argue that delays in reducing emissions is making the target of 2-degree "extremely difficult" and "arguably impossible" to achieve.
This, they say, raises the prospect of dangerous temperature rises later in the century.
Kevin Anderson, co-editor of "Four degrees and beyond: The potential for global temperature increase of four degrees and its implications," said last year: "Emissions are going in completely the wrong direction. A rise of two degrees Celsius is much more challenging than is widely accepted."
"These sorts of changes will certainly have some devastating impacts for ecosystems and for many people living around the planet," Anderson said.
If the predictions hold, sea levels could rise two meters by the end of the century, displacing around 2.5% of the world's population over the course of the century.
Furthermore, rainforests will be at risk of retreat in eastern Amazonia, Central America and some parts of Africa, according to a paper by Przemyslaw Zelazowski from the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University.
"What we do know, with a high degree of certainty, is that emissions are going up, and we know the sorts of rates they are going up at," Anderson said. "Unless we see some significant changes, we are going to see some much higher temperatures."














Serbia's justice minister announced a surprise press conference Tuesday, amid reports that a court has rejected genocide suspect Ratko Mladic's appeal against extradition.
The minister, Snezana Malovic, will brief reporters at 5 p.m. (11 a.m. ET).
Serbian prosecutors declined to answer CNN questions about whether Mladic's appeal had been rejected.
Mladic's lawyer said earlier he expects to learn Tuesday whether the former Bosnian Serb general will get new medical exams as he fights extradition to face charges at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

Lawyer Milos Saljic agues that Mladic would not be participate in a trial because of his ill health.
He wants Mladic examined by specialists "who can investigate his specific needs," including a gastroenterologist, cardiologist, psychiatrist and neurologist.
Mladic, 69, is wanted by the tribunal in connection with the massacre of nearly 8,000 Muslim men and boys at Srebrenica in 1995, among other charges. He was captured Thursday after more than 15 years in hiding.
His lawyer expects the Serbian court's response by Tuesday, he said Monday. The court has already ruled Mladic is fit to stand trial.
Saljic is also applying for Mladic's unpaid pension from the years when he was in hiding, he said, saying he was acting on behalf of Mladic's family.
Chief prosecutor Vladimir Vukcevic denied Monday that Mladic was in poor health, saying that he was "lively and joking," and had asked for Russian classics to read. He said Mladic would be sent to The Hague within days if his extradition appeal fails.
Mladic's son, Darko, told an ultranationalist rally Sunday that that his father is sick.
"He needs medical treatment that he is not getting," the younger Mladic said.
He described his father as "a freedom fighter," and said he had "defended his own nation, defended his people, which was his job."
The younger Mladic called on protesters to keep the demonstration peaceful on Sunday, but protesters clashed with Serbian police at the demonstration.
Nearly 20 people were injured in the violence -- seven police and 12 civilians -- according to police. They said they made more than 100 arrests.
The Serbian Radical Party held its protest Sunday in front of Serbia's parliament building.
Mladic gave himself up without a fight Thursday, despite having two handguns, according to Rasim Ljajic, the government minister in charge of searching for fugitive suspected war criminals.
Officials located Mladic in a village called Lazarevo, north of the Serbian capital, after culling information from his former comrades, those who supported him financially and his close family members, Ljajic said.

A defiant Sepp Blatter shrugged off allegations of corruption within FIFA Monday and said he would press ahead with his bid to be re-elected as president of football's world governing body for the fourth time.
Blatter will be the sole candidate in Wednesday's election in Zurich after Qatari Mohamed Bin Hammam, the only person standing against him, was suspended by the FIFA ethics committee Sunday, along with fellow leading official Jack Warner.
"We are not in a crisis, we are only in some difficulties and these can be solved inside our family," Blatter told a press conference Monday where he was continually pressed on both his own position and wider allegations of wrongdoing within FIFA.
"FIFA is strong enough to deal with our own problems," he asserted when asked if he had considered postponing Wednesday's vote by the 208-member FIFA Congress.
Was Blatter right to be defiant?

Blatter also ruled out a new vote on the venue for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.
"There is no issue for the World Cup in 2022," the 75-year-old Swiss said.
"I believe that the decision taken for the World Cup in 2022 was done exactly in the same pattern and in the same way as the 2018 tournament."
Bin Hamman, who led the Qatar bid, said earlier Monday that he would appeal his suspension.
"I am punished before I am found guilty," Bin Hammam said in a statement, saying he would "not accept" the decision.
Blatter, who was cleared by the ethics committee, did admit that the whole affair had affected FIFA's reputation.
"What has happened in the last few days and weeks. It has done great damage to the image of FIFA," he said.
The press conference was conducted in an acrimonious atmosphere as frustrated journalists shouted out questions.
"We're not in a bazaar here, we are in an important congress," retorted Blatter at one point.
It rounded off an extraordinary day of accusation and counter accusation, with CONCACAF chief Warner the focal point.
"At the end of the day, Blatter has to be stopped," Warner told gathered reporters, clearly angered by his expulsion from FIFA's executive committee.
Warner also released an email to reporters which implied that FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke believed there was corruption involved in Qatar's successful bid to host the 2022 World Cup.
"He thought he could buy FIFA as they bought the World Cup," Warner claims Valcke said of Bin Hammam in the email.
Qatar's football association Monday "categorically denied any wrongdoing" in connection with its bid, and said it was consulting lawyers and "urgently seeking clarification from FIFA" about the alleged Valcke comments.
Valcke, who is not accused of ethics violations and is not under any investigation, admitted sending the email, but said his comments had been taken out of context.

When police burst into the garden of the small house in northern Serbia where Europe's highest-ranking war crimes suspect had been hiding, the former Bosnian Serb general was found standing against a wall in a utility room normally used for storing farm equipment, a government minister told CNN.
Ratko Mladic -- the target of a near 16-year manhunt -- gave himself up without a fight, despite being in possession of two handguns, according to Rasim Ljajic, the minister in charge of searching for fugitive suspected war criminals.
Officials located Mladic in a village called Lazarevo, north of the Serbian capital, after culling information from his former comrades, those who supported him financially and his close family members, Ljajic said.
It is not clear what source led investigators to the former military commander, accused of ordering the 1995 massacre of some 8,000 Muslims in the eastern Bosnian town of Srebrenica.
While his arrest clears a major hurdle that once stood between Serbia and its long-awaited entrance into the European Union, the move could also usher in political backlash from the country's electorate, some of whom consider Mladic a hero.
"We're conscious of this danger," Ljajic told CNN. "We know we did something that didn't bring us joy or applause from the public. But we also know that we took great responsibility and did something that the political elite of any country is supposed to do."
He called Mladic's capture "a political investment," noting the government's desire to bring the war crimes suspect to justice "even if citizens punish us in the next elections."
Upon his arrest, the former general appeared polite and even offered his own expired identity card, unlike the forged documents often presented by other war crimes suspects, Ljajic said.
Yet his capture was seen as a considerable surprise, even to those searching for him.
Previous attempts to catch Mladic, which have been numerous, all failed. Ljajic also noted a lack of confidence among his few domestic backers and the swath of international figureheads who have long called for Mladic's arrest.

Balkan Politics
"The minority that supported our cooperation with the Hague tribunal was critical of us because they thought we were unsuccessful," Ljajic said, countering that argument by pointing to the extradition of 44 suspects to the U.N. War Crimes tribunal at The Hague, in the Netherlands.
"Our work was discredited, ridiculed and received very cynical comments."
Serbian officials "did this job almost without any sincere support even from those who believed we should cooperate," he added, alluding to critics who claimed Serbia sheltered the ex-general for more than a decade and a half.
The massacre at Srebrenica, which sparked international outcry and preceded a NATO bombing campaign, is now remembered as the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II.
Mladic allegedly presided over the five-day slaughter in July where Muslim men and boys were systematically executed in what was described at the U.N. war crimes tribunal as "the triumph of evil."
On the eve of the slaughter, Mladic broadcast a message on state television pledging to avenge centuries-old grievances of the Serbian state against the region's once-Ottoman Muslims.
Mladic's forces then encircled the town, once considered a U.N. "safe area" where thousands of Bosnian Muslims had sought refuge, allegedly conducting wholesale slaughter and rape, despite the presence of a few hundred lightly armed Dutch U.N. peacekeepers charged with protecting the area's residents and its refugees.
But Mladic's capture perhaps now offers the Balkans an opportunity to move past its dark history, removing a "barrier to reconciliation between Bosniaks, Serbs and Croats," said Sabine Freizer, an International Crisis Group Program Director.
The former general is considered the last of the fugitive war criminal suspects in the region, following the capture of Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and former Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who died in jail in 2006 during his trial at The Hague.
But residents in the Serbian capital offered mixed emotions as to what a post-Mladic Serbia signifies.
"We're a little worn out about all the talks about the crime of innocent people and all that," said Damir Jovic, an employee of an information technology company in Belgrade. "I think people are just tired of that talk and want to get over it."
His wife, Sonja Damnjanovic, disagreed, while also disputing notions that Mladic's capture could pay dividends in her country's economic future.
"The important thing is that a man who did some bad things is captured for what he had done, not for our need to go into the European Union," she said.
Last month, a government poll (taken before Mladic's arrest) showed that more than 78% of the population was not personally prepared to report the whereabouts of the former military commander.
More than 68% of Serbs do not consider The Hague tribunal just, Minister Ljajic told CNN.
And 53% of the population disagreed that Mladic should be extradited to that court, he said, offering a glimpse into the political landscape confronting Serbian President Boris Tadic, who announced the ex-general's capture.
Many Serbs "consider the Hague more of a political than legal institution," Ljajic added.
Meanwhile, a medical team has determined that Mladic is in good enough shape to be extradited to face a war crimes tribunal, a court spokeswoman in Belgrade said Friday.
While the war crimes suspect suffers from several chronic conditions, the team said there are no immediate problems barring a move.
This comes after five doctors examined Mladic Thursday night, according to the ex-general's lawyer, Milos Saljic.













Almost two years after Air France Flight 447 plunged into the southern Atlantic Ocean killing all 228 people aboard, investigators have released a report on what they believe caused the crash.
After an extensive search using miniature submersible vehicles, the aircraft's cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were found on the ocean floor at the beginning of May.
After analyzing the data, France's Bureau of Investigation and Analysis (BEA) released its report Friday saying the flight from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed because the aircraft's speed sensors gave invalid readings.
When did Flight 447 go down?
Flight 447 -- which was en route to Paris from Rio de Janeiro -- made its last contact with Brazil's Atlantic Control Center (ACC) at around 01:33 GMT on June 1, 2009, informing the center of the plane's position as it crossed the Atlantic.
Investigators: Jet crash data recovered
Soon after, Brazil's air control contacted Dakar's control center in North Africa and reported that AF 447 was entering an area on its route known for constant bands of severe turbulence, officials said.
There was no further contact with the plane.

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates the ocean depth in the area at 3,000 meters (about 9,840 feet) to 7,500 meters (24,600 feet). Brazilian officials have said the sea depth in the area is around 2,000 to 3,000 meters (6,562 to 9,842 feet).
The latest search covered a 46-mile (75-kilometer) radius around the last known position of Flight 447, investigators said.
According to the BEA the underwater terrain in this area is rough with underwater mountains and valleys.
"It is a mountain range as big as the Alps," David Learmount of Flight International told CNN before the release of Friday's report. "There was always the possibility that the wreckage from the aircraft disappeared down a crevasse. This is not a flat-bottom environment like the North Sea is."
"Therefore it is an unprecedented search in terms of depth and sub-sea terrain."
















Up until recently, the memory module of the aircraft's data recorder -- a vital device for crash investigators which records any instructions sent to the aircraft's electronic systems -- had been missing. As a result, some experts feared it would not work even if recovered.
"Pressure and corrosion have likely damaged the wreckage, especially as it has been down there for so long," said Learmount. "Flight recorders are not designed to withstand pressures of the depths that this aircraft actually went to."
But he warned that flight recorders recovered from other crash sites have not worked when they should have, with the reverse also true.
Do we know why Flight 447 crashed?
The BEA report findings say the airplane climbed to 38,000 ft when "the stall warning was triggered and the airplane stalled." It then descended, crashing into the Atlantic. The descent lasted 3 minutes and 30 seconds and the engines remained operational, said the report.
Studies of the debris and bodies that were found soon after the crash led the BEA to conclude the plane hit the water belly first, essentially intact. Oxygen masks were not deployed, indicating that the cabin did not depressurize, the BEA said in a 2009 report.
Tests have already brought into question the performance of pitot tubes, which measure the pressure exerted on the plane as it flies through the air, and are part of a system used to determine air speed.
Before it crashed, Flight 447 sent out 24 automated error messages that suggested the plane may have been flying too fast or too slow through the thunderstorms, officials have said.
The European Aviation Safety Agency issued a directive in late August requiring airlines to replace pitot tubes manufactured by Thales Avionics on Airbus A330s and A340s. It said airlines should replace them with other Thales tubes and those manufactured by Goodrich.
The lack of speed, wind or direction information also prevented the Autopilot system from functioning, said air accident investigator Alain Bouillard said at the time of the crash. "This tells us that the plane has to be, in this case, directed by the pilot," he said












Flight 447 was passing through an area prone to volatile and dangerous weather known as the Inter-tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), when it went down. The ITCZ is a belt of low pressure that wraps around the planet. Clouds and storms form along it because it is literally where the winds of the world's hemispheres meet.
Here, air and water temperatures are typically in the mid-80s. The warm, moist air is heated further by the blazing tropical sun. Steamy air, coming off the ocean, rises until it hits cooler, drier air aloft, forming clouds and thunderstorms.
These gigantic storms contain volatile updrafts and downdrafts that can move at speeds of 100 mph. The height of these storms also can tower to more than 10 miles in the air. Even if you stacked two dozen of the world's tallest skyscrapers on top of each other, they still wouldn't reach the tops of the biggest thunderstorms of the ITCZ.
Flight recorders are not designed to withstand pressures of the depths that this aircraft actually went to.

However Learmount pointed out that hundreds of airliners pass through the ITCZ every day without incident. "There was another Air France flight 30 minutes behind Flight 447 that night and it encountered no problems," he said.
Any other theories?
According to Learmount, many aviation experts have yet to rule out the human factor. "The crash happened at around 2 am on a dark night when the error messages suddenly appeared and the autopilot tripped out." He said the crew, possibly at their deepest circadian low at this point, suddenly have this problem and they "fixate" on it.
"This is a syndrome," he said. "There have been lots of accidents where pilots have fixated on correcting a relatively minor problem and lose sight of the macro problem. Now we don't know that, but we do know the aircraft acted as if it was not being controlled purposefully.
"Whether it was out of control -- and I doubt this -- it was not being controlled. Imagine it is 2 am and two sleepy pilots encounter a problem. They don't have much to do so they decide to troubleshoot this problem. They fixate on it and forget the autopilot has tripped.
"The airplane meanwhile goes into a lazy spiral descent -- the pilots don't notice as it is all very gentle. And when they look up they don't believe what their instruments tell them and they get disorientated and can't recover."
He highlighted a similar case in 2004 when pilot disorientation and loss of control caused a Flash Airlines Boeing 737-300 to crash in the Red Sea shortly after take off from the Egyptian resort of Sharm el Sheikh. Though Egyptian authorities disputed the claim, aviation safety officials in France and the U.S. cited "spatial disorientation" as the likely cause based on evidence available, according to the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB).













 A robot explorer has revealed ancient markings inside a secret chamber at Egypt's Great Pyramid of Giza.
The markings, which have lain unseen for 4,500 years, were filmed using a bendy camera small enough to fit through a hole in a stone door at the end of a narrow tunnel.
It is hoped they could shed light on why the tiny chamber and the tunnel -- one of several mysterious passages leading from the larger King's and Queen's chambers -- were originally built.
The markings take the form of hieroglyphic symbols in red paint as well as lines in the stone that may have been made by masons when the chamber was being built.
The big question is the purpose of these tunnels.

According to Peter Der Manuelian, Philip J. King Professor of Egyptology at Harvard University, similar lines have been found elsewhere in Giza. "Sometimes they identify the work gang (who built the room), sometimes they give a date and sometimes they give guidelines to mark cuttings or directional symbols about the beginning or end of a block," he said.
"The big question is the purpose of these tunnels," he added. "There are architectural explanations, symbolic explanations, religious explanations -- even ones relating to the alignment of the stars -- but the final word on them is yet to be written. The challenge is that no human can fit inside these channels so the only way to do this exploration is with robots."
Pictures of the markings have been published in the Annales du Service Des Antiquities de l'Egypte, the official publication of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, following an international mission led by the Minister for Antiquities.
The robot explorer that took the images is named Djedi, after the magician whom Pharaoh Khufu consulted when planning the layout of the Great Pyramid. It was designed and built by engineers at the University of Leeds, in collaboration with Scoutek UK and Dassault Systemes, France.













Although robots have previously sent back pictures from within the pyramid's tunnels, Djedi's creators say it is the first to be able to explore the walls and floors in detail, rather than just take pictures looking straight ahead, thanks to a "micro snake" camera.
The camera also scrutinized two copper pins embedded in the door to the chamber at the end of the tunnel. In a statement, Shaun Whitehead, of Scoutek UK, said: "People have been wondering about the purpose of these pins for over 20 years. It had been suggested that they were handles, keys or even parts of an electrical power plant, but our new pictures from behind the pins cast doubt on these theories.
"We now know that these pins end in small, beautifully made loops, indicating that they were more likely ornamental rather than electrical connections or structural features. Also, the back of the door is polished so it must have been important. It doesn't look like it was a rough piece of stone used to stop debris getting into the shaft."
The team's next task is to look at the chamber's far wall to check whether it is a solid block of stone or another door.
"We are keeping an open mind and will carry out whatever investigations are needed to work out what these shafts and doors are for," said Whitehead. "It is like a detective story, we are using the Djedi robot and its tools to piece the evidence together."















Amnesty International's demand for the release of Eynulla Fatullayev, a journalist from Azerbaijan, was met just two days after the organization's UK branch launched a social media campaign.
"[He] was freed after we launched a Twitter campaign tweeting the President from Azerbaijan with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, if not thousands of messages, saying this man does not deserve to be held in jail," Larry Cox, Executive Director of Amnesty International U.S. tells CNN.
"He's a journalist, he wrote an article. You can't put people in jail for that."
Mr. Fataullayev is just one of the many individuals Amnesty International has supported over its 50 year history.
The organization is made up of three million supporters, members and activists from around the globe. It has offices in 80 countries and produces between four and five hundred reports on human rights annually.
50 years of Amnesty International
Its aim is to hold governments accountable; to demand that they adhere to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the United Nations in 1948.
"What makes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights relevant is what has always made it relevant. That's the struggle of people for freedom and dignity," says Cox.
"Governments have never wanted to live up to the promises they made more than 60 years ago. It's when people take to the streets, people bring pressure to bear, people insist we want our rights to be respected, that the world has to take notice."












It's hard to believe an organization that operates on a global scale came from such simple beginnings: In 1961 British lawyer Peter Beneson was outraged after he learned of two Portuguese students sentenced to jail for no other reason but for toasting to liberty in a Lisbon restaurant.
Beneson wrote an article about political prisoners that was published on the front page of the UK's Observer newspaper. He encouraged others to join his cause -- to learn of political prisoners and write letters to the regimes that imprisoned them.
"It began with people sitting down at their desk and writing letters, and knowing that thousands, tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands of other people were doing the same," explains Cox.
"Dictators and oppressors from around the world were being flooded by these messages, making them aware that they had to change or they were going to get increasingly isolated."
As a tribute to the two students in Lisbon who sparked the idea in the organization's founder, supporters of Amnesty international still meet annually to toast to freedom.
"Every year around this time, people gather in all parts of the world to also raise a toast to freedom," says Cox.
"It's not really a toast to Amnesty International. It's a toast to all those people who are risking their lives, risking their freedom, in this fight for human rights. That's who the toast is for. It reminds us of what we still have to do and it keeps us going."

More than 30 people were arrested Saturday in central Moscow during the sixth attempt by gay rights groups to hold a parade in the city.
According to the group, Gay Russia, far right groups clashed with activists who were gathered in front of the Kremlin wall and city hall.
A total of 18 gay activists and 14 anti-gay activists were arrested, according to Moscow City police.
A police spokesman told CNN that the group did not have permission to gather publically for a parade.
Three prominent gay rights activists, Americans Dan Choi and Andy Thayer, and France's Louis-George Tin, were among those detained.
"We have been asking for the last six years to gather. We are being deprived of a very simple right that is taken for granted in democratic countries," Nikolai Alexeyev, Head of Gay Russia, chief organizer of the Moscow Gay Pride Parade told CNN.
Alexeyev said as soon as activists took out their banners and flags, dozens of members of an ultra-Orthodox group attacked the activists.
Gay rights flags and banners that read 'Russia is not Iran' were displayed in the crowd.
Last week the city denied the group a parade permit due to "a number of complaints", Moscow's deputy mayor, Luydmila Shevtsova said, according to reports from national new agency Ria Novosti.
Representatives of religious groups, ultra-nationalists and the Moscow City Parent Committee had filed complaints against the parade.
This past October, the European Court of Human Rights fined Russia for banning gay parades in the capital.














Russia will lift its grain export ban on July 1 this year, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin announced Saturday.
Putin made the announcement at his country residence during a meeting with Viktor Zubkov, his deputy in charge of agriculture. The meeting was shown on Russian state TV.
The temporary ban has been in effect since Aug. 15, 2010, following an unprecedented six-week heat wave and drought that wiped out crops in many farming areas.
The 2010 grain harvests amounted to just 60.9 million tons -- a staggering 37% drop from 2009, according to the Russian Agriculture Ministry. Russia -- which had been the world's third-largest wheat exporter -- stopped all exports of wheat, rye, barley and corn, as well as flour, boosting a sharp increase in world grain prices.
Despite a late spring, sowing in most regions is going well, and a good harvest is expected this year, Zubkov said.
"We are lifting the grain export ban from July 1 this year, but I am asking you to work most actively, as you did in recent years, and ensure the work of the agriculture ministry, other government departments and financial institutions so as to support our agricultural producers in this difficult period, and the sowing campaign, which is not fully over yet, let alone the harvesting," Putin said.
"You should very carefully monitor what is happening in this economic sector that it so important for us and, using all our mechanisms, support agricultural producers," Putin told Zubkov.
"The lifting of the export ban is one of the measures to support agricultural producers who today have an export potential," Putin said.
The government forecast for the 2011 wheat crop has been set at about 85 million tons, and agriculture experts estimate that with the grain export ban lifted, Russia may export 10 to 13 million tons of grain in 2011, mostly wheat.














Latvia's president disolved the national legislature on Saturday, according to the Baltic country's official news agency LETA.
President Valdis Zatlers made his announcement following a nationally televised address. The move takes effect immediately, LETA reported, though there was no immediate indication.
Zatlers made the move one day after he met U.S. President Barack Obama at a meeting in Warsaw, Poland, that also included other central and eastern European leaders.
On Thursday, the International Monetary Fund authorized a $171 million loan for Latvia. According to the IMF website, the loan came because "strong policy actions ... have helped restore confidence, contributed to economic recovery, and enabled significant progress toward Latvia's goal of euro adoption."
Reached Saturday, IMF spokeswoman Simonetta Nardin said the organization had no immediate comment -- either on the political situation in Latvia or how it might affect its relations with the fund.
Also on Thursday, the World Bank approved a $143 million loan, which expires in 10 years, to protect "vulnerable groups ... during the economic contraction, to mitigate the social costs of fiscal consolidation, and to ensure that structural reforms lay a foundation for sustainable improvements in the social sectors," that world body's website said.
During a speech last month at The European Institute, a public policy group dedicated to fostering U.S.-European relations, Zatlers said "Latvia was arguably the hardest-hit country" in the latest economic crisis because the global downturn came at the same time as an independent dip in Latvia itself.
Since taking various measures, including tightening government spending, Zatlers said that Latvia -- a U.S. ally -- was on the rebound. He claimed that exports had risen back to precrisis levels and predicted the government deficit would fall to 3% of the gross domestic product by next year.










 It is now remembered as the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II.
In a five-day orgy of slaughter at Srebrenica in July 1995, up to 8,000 Muslims were systematically exterminated in what was described at the U.N. war crimes tribunal as "the triumph of evil."
Former Bosnian Serb commander-in-chief General Ratko Mladic, who is accused of direct involvement in the genocide at Srebrenica, was arrested on Thursday after more than 15 years on the run.
In 1995, Srebrenica was designated a U.N. "safe area."
A judge at The Hague tribunal was later to describe what happened there as "truly scenes from hell written on the darkest pages of human history."
Thousands of Bosnian Muslims had sought refuge in the spa town of Srebrenica in 1995 as the Bosnian Serb army marched towards them.
They were protected by just 100 lightly equipped Dutch peacekeepers -- who proved no match for the advancing, heavily-armed Serb army.

Denied reinforcements, the Dutch were forced to stand aside while Serb troops intent on "ethnic cleansing" did their worst -- the peacekeepers even witnessing the summary execution of civilians.
In the days before the onslaught, 30,000 Muslims fleeing the advancing Serb army were crammed into the town. Within days there was not one Muslim left.
A great number fled -- only for many of them to be wiped out in Serb ambushes -- but the men who stayed fared the worst.
Thousands of men and boys as young as 10 were rounded up and murdered. Those who tried to hide in their homes were, according to evidence at the trial of Serb General Radislav Krstic at The Hague in March 2000, "hunted down like dogs and slaughtered."
Serbian TV footage shows women and children being separated from the men and put on buses.
In a sickening show of "reassurance" Mladic -- now on the war crimes tribunal's most wanted list -- told the women everyone would be taken out by bus out and safely reunited.
When the cameras were turned off the real face of the Serb army emerged as the slaughter began.
More than 60 truckloads of refugees were taken from Srebrenica to execution sites where they were bound, blindfolded, and shot with automatic rifles.
Some of the executions were carried out at night under arc lights. Industrial bulldozers then pushed the bodies into mass graves.
Some were buried alive, a French policeman who collected evidence from Bosnian Muslims, Jean-Rene Ruez, told The Hague tribunal in 1996.
He gave evidence that Bosnian Serb forces had killed and tortured refugees at will. Streets were littered with corpses, he said, and rivers were red with blood. Many people committed suicide to avoid having their noses, lips and ears chopped off, he said.
Among other lurid accounts of mass murder, Ruez cited cases of adults being forced to kill their children or watching as soldiers ended the young lives.
"One soldier approached a woman in the middle of a crowd," he said. "Her child was crying. The soldier asked why the child was crying and she explained that he was hungry. The soldier made a comment like, 'He won't be hungry anymore.' He slit the child's throat in front of everybody."
Later it was revealed that Mladic had been able to press on unhindered by issuing ultimatums to the U.N. protection force.
It was suggested the U.N. high command had promised to stop air strikes against the Serb army in return for the release of 370 U.N. soldiers held prisoner -- and Mladic took this as the green light to attack Srebrenica.
The Commander of the Dutch U.N. troops, Col. Thomas Karremans, told The Hague tribunal in 1996 that he had first requested NATO air strikes when Mladic's troops began their assault on July 6, but that the request was not granted until July 11 when Srebrenica fell. By then, Karremans said, it "was too late and too little."
Karremans said a long Serb blockade before the attack had left the lightly armed Dutch battalion desperately short of food and fuel, but requests for fresh supplies went unheeded.
In 1999 the U.N. admitted its error in expecting 100 Dutch troops to deter the Bosnian Serb army.

 World leaders and human rights groups celebrated the arrest of former Serbian army commander Ratko Mladic on Thursday, calling it "historic" and "an important step forward."
It is "an important day for international justice," said the office of Serge Brammertz, prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, in a written statement.
"Mladic's arrest clearly signals that the commitment to international criminal justice is entrenched. Today's events show that people responsible for grave violations of international humanitarian law can no longer count on impunity."
The office awaits Mladic's transfer to The Hague, where he will stand trial, the statement said.

Mladic is charged with crimes including the murders of nearly 8,000 Bosnian Muslim men and boys in Srebrenica in 1995; forcible transfers and detentions of Bosnian Muslims and Croats; a "terror campaign and the shelling and sniping of civilians in Sarajevo by Bosnian Serb forces under his command"; and the taking of United Nations military observers as hostages, the statement said.
"With the news of the arrest," Brammertz said, "we think first and foremost of the victims of the crimes committed during the conflicts in the former Yugoslavia. These victims have endured unimaginable horrors -- including the genocide in Srebrenica -- and redress for their suffering is long overdue."
U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called it a "historic day for international justice. This arrest marks an important step in our collective fight against impunity as well as for the work of the" tribunal.
He praised Serbian President Boris Tadic and the Serbian government.
U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Thursday that she hopes "Mladic's trial, along with that of Radovan Karadzic, and the recent ICTY convictions of Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markac, as well as the dozens of earlier convictions, will help victims and their families see justice done and receive acknowledgement of their suffering."
Former Serbian leader Karadzic -- who was arrested in Belgrade, Serbia, in 2008 -- faces 11 counts of genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. He has denied the charges.
Gotovina commanded Croatia's Split military district during the mid-1990s war, while Markac headed Croatia's Interior Ministry's Special Police.
Both were convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity.

NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said he strongly welcomed the news. "As Bosnian Serb military commander, General Mladic played a key role in some of the darkest episodes of Balkan and European history, including the siege of Sarajevo and the massacre of thousands of Bosnian men and boys in Srebrenica in 1995. Almost 16 years since his indictment for genocide and other war crimes, his arrest finally offers a chance for justice to be done."
The White House issued a statement Thursday applauding Tadic and the government of Serbia on "their determined efforts to ensure that Mladic was found and that he faces justice."
"We look forward to his expeditious transfer to The Hague," the statement said. "Today is an important day for the families of Mladic's many victims, for Serbia, for Bosnia, for the United States, and for international justice.
"May the families of Mladic's victims find some solace in today's arrest, and may this deepen the ties among the people of the region," it added.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy welcomed the news while hosting the G8 summit in Deauville, France, calling the arrest "very big news."
"It is a very brave decision by the Serbian president, and it's an important step towards the integration in the near future (of Serbia) into the European Union," he said.
European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton called the arrest "an important step forward for Serbia and for international justice." It is "a very positive development for the European Union, for Serbia's neighbours, but most of all for the rule of law in Serbia itself," she said. "The families of his countless victims deserve justice."
British Foreign Secretary William Hague said the arrest "is a historic moment for a region that was torn apart by the appalling wars of the 1990s."
He added, "Our sympathies are with all those who lost loved ones during those conflicts. Today should mark the beginning of a new chapter for the countries of Western Balkans."
British Prime Minister David Cameron said, "there is a very good reason why the long arm of the international law has been looking for this man for such a long time."
In a news release, Interpol called Mladic "Europe's most wanted war crimes suspect."
"The arrest by Serbian police of Ratko Mladic, an alleged architect of human carnage and mass murder, is a triumph for international justice," Interpol Secretary General Ronald K. Noble said in the release.
Amnesty International's senior director of international law, Widney Brown, said, "It took more than 15 years, but at last the people who suffered have hope that he will be brought to justice."
Brown called on Serbian authorities to renew their efforts "to arrest the remaining indicted suspect General Goran Hadzic," who is believed to be in the region, and "bring him to justice."
Madeleine Albright, former U.S. secretary of state, said Mladic's trial "should teach again the grim reality of ethnic cleansing and, I hope, bring some comfort to those who survived."
"Mladic tried to become a conquering hero. Instead, he lived as a fugitive in obscurity and now faces years in custody. Justice works," she said in a statement. "It is a welcome sign that Serbian officials arrested him. An emerging democracy is helping to confront its own past."











As fighting raged between Croatians and Muslims in the central Bosnian town of Vitez, he saw the execution of a Muslim police chief -- the father of a classmate.
"I saw him get on his knees, begging for his life, and they shot him point blank," he said. "Some people were cheering. But it was horrible."
Now, another date will burn bright in Samija's mind: May 26, 2011, the day Serbian army commander Ratko Mladic was arrested after eluding capture for more than 15 years.
Mladic, the highest-ranking war crimes suspect who was still at large from the Balkan wars of the 1990s, is wanted on charges including genocide, extermination and murder by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.

For the Bosnian victims of that war, Mladic's arrest provided some sense of closure, just as many of the loved ones of those who perished in the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks sighed in relief at the news of Osama bin Laden's death.
But the television repeats of images of Mladic and of events that took place during the war could also act as a trigger and make people relive their trauma, said psychologist Steven Bruce, director of the Center for Trauma Recovery at the University of Missouri in St. Louis, which has a large Bosnian refugee community.
"It's a double-edged sword," Bruce said. "But in the long term, it's good news. I do think it does relieve some anxieties that he would never be found."
Samija, 32, who fled the war with his family to restart life in Atlanta, was elated by the news of Mladic's arrest.
"Until we clear our history, we cannot move," he said.
In another part of Atlanta, Nazifa Garib was hard at work at her bakery, churning out dough for tandoori naan. She had gone to work before sunrise and had not heard the news.
"Oh, my God," she said, pausing for a few seconds.
"I have chills right now. This is very good news."
Before the Gulf War, Garib worked in Baghdad but returned to her native Bosnia in the early 1990s. She was reluctant to speak of the brutality she witnessed, of the family she lost. She said she felt relief that Mladic, whom she blamed for much of what she had suffered, was finally caught.
She hopes he will be hanged like Saddam Hussein, but in public, where his victims can watch.

Sanja Starcevic says, "You can't bring back all the people they killed, from all sides."
Sanja Starcevic, whose family runs Neretva, a Bosnian eatery in suburban Atlanta, said the conflict was indescribable.
Like the victims of the tornado this week in Missouri who were at a loss for words, the 55-year-old Starcevic said it was impossible to speak about what she had seen, especially in English, a second language.
"You have to be there and see how it is," she said.
She was glad Mladic will finally face justice but said things will never be the same in Bosnia.
"You can't bring back all the people they killed, from all sides," she said.
Edin Prozorac, 33, a Bosnian Muslim from Kennesaw, Georgia, sipped coffee outside Nerevta and described a life of "slave labor" under Serbian rule during his teen years, performing dirty jobs like cleaning streets, loading trucks, cutting trees and digging channels at the whim of the ruling forces.
One haunting memory typifies the humiliation: A Serbian soldier made him repeatedly get up on and jump down from a trailer and put a gun to his head.
"It was hell," he said, "Seven days a week."

Senad Cajic says the arrest was "too late" and Mladic should not have been able to enjoy his life for 15 years.
Another Bosnian Muslim -- Senad Cajic, 49, of Kennesaw, Georgia -- said he lived about 45 days under Serbian rule before he escaped to a Bosnian-controlled region.
He remembers stiff curfews and the killing of one man who broke them. Also, he recalls the scarce availability of food.
"We were really scared," he said.
Eventually, he joined the Bosnian military -- more of a militia than an army -- thwarted persistent Serbian assaults and found a safe place for his family in Bosnian territory.
Cajic said many Bosnians returned home after the warfare, but he couldn't go back to his house because it burned. Eventually, he and his family made their way to the United States.
As for Mladic, Cajic said, the arrest was "too late."
Unlike his countrymen who fought, fled for their lives, nursed war injuries and died, Mladic "enjoyed his life for 15 years."
Mladic's arrest cannot erase the mistrust embedded deeply in Bosnian hearts, said Hamdija Custovic, who was only 12 when he witnessed war's horrors. The men in his hometown of Gacko were rounded up to be taken to concentration camps. His father escaped to the mountains, where he hid for four months.
Custovic, 31, used to have Serb friends in school, but he was segregated from them before the war started. Later, they brought guns and knives to school, intending to turn them on their former buddies.

Now, the Charlotte, North Carolina, resident sometimes hears from those former classmates on Facebook. But he can't bring himself to accept their offer to be friends. He doesn't trust them.
Reconciliation was one of the themes sounded by Serbian President Boris Tadic as he announced Mladic's arrest. But Custovic, the spokesman for the Congress of North American Bosniaks, was skeptical.
"I think it is one of the steps," he said. "But we have to keep in mind that this cannot end here. Just because they arrested (former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan) Karadzic and Mladic, it does not absolve Serbs of responsibility for the campaign that was led by thousands of soldiers."
The Germans, said Custovic, accepted responsibility for the Holocaust. There are many Serbs, he said, who will still deny that ethnic cleansing took place in Bosnia.
The 1992-95 Bosnian war was the longest of the conflicts that erupted after the disintegration of communist Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.
Backed by the government of Slobodan Milosevic, Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a bloody campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations.
Mladic stands accused of leading the two-year siege of the city of Sarajevo that killed thousands and later, the systematic extermination of about 8,000 Muslims in Srebrenica, now remembered as the worst atrocity in Europe since World War II.
Muhamed Mehmedovic's father and brother were killed by Mladic's soldiers. Their bodies were found in mass graves. He traveled for seven days and nights with his mother and surviving brother to escape Srebrenica's atrocities, and he, like Custovic, made a new life in Charlotte.
He has waited many years for the perpetrators of the Srebrenica massacre to come to justice.
"They need to get every one of them," he said.
Mladic's arrest was huge for Mehmedovic, 32. The entire world was watching the arrest of the man who destroyed his family.
Rusmin Lilic, 40, a Bosnian Muslim from Stone Mountain, Georgia, lived through the worst of days in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital besieged by Serbian forces.
A member of Bosnia's fledgling armed forces, he was wounded twice and said "you had to defend your home. If not, you'd probably be killed."
He recalls two particularly horrid events in Sarajevo: snipers killing a group of kids on a cherry tree and a market bombing that killed about 70 people.
The violence hardened him, and he mourned deeply when his good friend in the army died, but as more deaths piled up, he stopped crying. The violence and the incremental "psychological killing" ground down a dispirited populace.
"No food, no water, no shampoo, limited everything," he said. "It's the worst thing for everybody."
"I don't think the people will ever forget. I'll not forget that war."
Sitting outside the Neretva coffee shop and grocery store during his lunch break, Lilic sported national pride on his T-shirt, which commemorates a soccer game last decade between a Sarajevan and a Turkish team.
"I never gave up on my country," said Lilic.
Lilic has paid visits to Bosnia since he moved away but said he'd be an "enemy" to his children if he chose to take his family back to live in the homeland. Perhaps, he said, he'll go back "to be buried."
Prozorac said he's debating whether to discuss the past with his American children. He has never returned home.
For Prozorac and many other Bosnians, the scars will never go away.

Ratko Mladic, the onetime Bosnian Serb commander accused of presiding over Europe's worst massacre since World War II, was in custody Thursday after more than 15 years in hiding, Serbia's president announced.
Mladic was the highest-ranking war crimes suspect to remain at large from the wars that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s. He was arrested in the Serbian town of Lazarevo after a three-year investigation, President Boris Tadic said in a dramatic and hastily announced news conference in Belgrade.
"All war criminals must face justice," Tadic said. He refused to give more details about the operation but said Serbian authorities continue to probe "who aided and abetted Mladic ... and those people will face justice."
Mladic, now 69, led Bosnian Serb forces during the 1992-95 war that followed Bosnia-Herzegovina's secession from Yugoslavia. The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has charged him with leading a genocidal campaign against Bosnia's Muslim and Croat populations and with having "direct involvement" in the 1995 killings of nearly 8,000 men and boys in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica.
He was transferred from Lazarevo, about 80 km (50 miles) north of Belgrade, to courthouse in the capital for a preliminary hearing after his arrest, and the tribunal said it looked forward to his "expeditious transfer" to the Hague, Netherlands, for trial.
Once there, he will be allowed to enter a plea to the charges against him, which include genocide, crimes against humanity and violating the laws of war, according to a statement from the court.
"The arrest of Mladic is a milestone in the Tribunal's history and brings the institution closer to the successful completion of its mandate," the tribunal said. The sole remaining fugitive from the court is former Croatian Serb leader Goran Hadzic, "and the Tribunal hopes he will be arrested in the very near future."
Mladic is accused of leading a campaign of "ethnic cleansing," widespread killing, forcible deportations, torture, forced labor and physical, psychological and sexual violence during the Bosnian war. But he remains a hero to some of his former soldiers, said David Owen, a former European Union envoy to Yugoslavia, suggesting that his supporters had sheltered him in Serbia.
The international police agency Interpol praised the arrest as "a triumph for international justice." Interpol officials had met with Tadic in January to discuss closer cooperation in the hunt for war crimes suspects, the organization's secretary-general, Ronald Noble, said in a statement on Mladic's capture.
"After today's arrest, no one should doubt Serbia's commitment to the rule of law and justice," Noble said.
Tadic said the arrest will help the process of reconciliation throughout the Balkans and should pave the way for Serbia's entry into the EU. James Ker-Lindsay, a senior research fellow at the London School of Economics and Political Science, called Thursday "an incredibly important day for Serbia."
"Ratko Mladic was the person to get hold of. This totally transforms Serbian prospects for getting into the European Union," he said.
EU foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton hailed the arrest as a victory for "the rule of law in Serbia" and praised Tadic and his government for "this courageous action."
Ashton called for the quick transfer of the suspect to the Netherlands for trial. But Tadic declined to say how long the extradition would take, explaining it was not up to him.
Mladic had been on the run since the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina ended in 1995. The Croatian newspaper Jutarnji List was the first to report his arrest, saying police were doing DNA tests on a suspect to determine whether he was the notorious former commander.
Mladic was the last fugitive from a triumvirate of Serbian leaders accused of genocide against Muslims and Croats as the three populations fought a brutal war over Yugoslav territory.
Former Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic was toppled in 2000 and sent to face charges in The Hague. He died in 2006 while the trial was still going on.
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was arrested in July 2008 and is now on trial in The Hague.
Karadzic was removed from power under the Dayton Peace accords that ended three years of brutal fighting. He went into hiding, grew a full white beard and long hair, and was working in an alternative medicine clinic in Belgrade -- right under the noses of authorities -- when he was captured.
Karadzic has insisted on defending himself at The Hague. Prosecutors accuse him of deliberately obstructing the trial with delaying tactics, and judges have threatened to impose a defense lawyer on him if he does not cooperate.
The Bosnian war was the longest of the conflicts spawned by the breakup of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s. Backed by the Milosevic government, Bosnian Serb forces seized control of more than half the country and launched a campaign against the Muslim and Croat populations.
The United Nations declared Srebrenica to be a safe haven, and tens of thousands of Bosnian Muslims flooded in, expecting protection. But a small contingent of Dutch U.N. peacekeepers, lightly armed and aware that no reinforcements were coming, stood aside and allowed Mladic's troops to overrun Srebrenica, leading to the slaughter.
NATO intervened in the conflict, bombing Bosnian Serb military positions. The United States brought the leaders of the warring factions to an agreement in Dayton, Ohio, in 1995, bringing the violence to an end.













A medical team in Serbia has determined that war crimes suspect Ratko Mladic is in good enough shape to be extradited to face a war crimes tribunal, a court spokeswoman in Belgrade said Friday.
While Mladic suffers from several chronic conditions, the team said there are no immediate problems barring a move. This comes after five doctors examined Mladic Thursday night, said Mladic's lawyer, Milos Saljic.
"The court decided that conditions for extradition have been met," court spokeswoman Maya Kovacevic said.
The determination was made during a deportation hearing Friday, held to decide whether Mladic will be transferred to the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands.

Mladic refused to make any statement before the court, but Saljic said the Mladic team will appeal. That appeal could come by Monday.
Asked how soon the judge would rule on the appeal, Kovacevic answered, "immediately."
Mladic's son, Darko, said his father has trouble speaking and his right arm is partially paralyzed.
"We saw him for the first time in many years. He's in bad shape," Darko Mladic said to reporters in front of the courthouse. "His health is very deteriorated."
He said the family is asking the court to send Mladic to a hospital for treatment and analysis and wants Russian doctors to examine him. His father is not guilty of the grave charges against him, insisted Darko Mladic.
But Bruno Vekaric, the deputy prosecutor of Serbia's Special Court for War Crimes, dismissed the family's account of Mladic's health as a defense ploy.
"He's like a young man," Vekaric said. "He's not so ill or in a bad situation."
Mladic's right arm seemed to be bothering him, but he was fine Friday, Vekaric said.
Mladic refused to read the indictment against him, telling the judge, "I don't want to read the papers of the tribunal," according to Vekaric.
An angry Mladic accused Vekaric of being a CIA agent but apologized Friday, the deputy prosecutor said. He asked Vekaric for a few books by Russian authors Leo Tolstoy and Nikolai Gogol. He also made one other request, one that the prosecutor found odd coming from the man once known as the "Butcher of Bosnia."
"He asked for strawberries," Vekaric said, laughing.
Mladic is in a jail near Belgrade facing charges that he presided over Europe's worst massacre since World War II. He was arrested Thursday after more than 15 years in hiding.
Mladic was the highest-ranking fugitive to remain at large after the conflicts that accompanied the breakup of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.
Saljic described Mladic as a "ruin of a man" who has suffered two heart attacks and three strokes since 1996.
Serbian President Boris Tadic said Serbian authorities are still investigating who aided Mladic during his decade and a half on the run, but he called allegations that the country's military sheltered him "rubbish."
"At the end of the day, he was protected by a very small group of people from his family," Tadic said. He acknowledged that Mladic may have been aided by military officers early on, "but at the end of that process, I don't believe that."
The former Yugoslav army officer was the commanding general of Bosnian Serb forces during the 1992-95 war that followed Bosnia-Herzegovina's secession from Yugoslavia.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia has charged him with leading a genocidal campaign against Bosnia's Muslim and Croat populations, including "direct involvement" in the 1995 killings of nearly 8,000 men and boys in the Muslim enclave of Srebrenica -- the worst European massacre since the Holocaust.
However, Mladic remains a hero to some Serbs, and small outbursts of anger in reaction to his arrest were seen in Belgrade late Thursday.










 Leaders at the Group of Eight summit in France expressed their support for democracy activists in the Middle East and North Africa on Friday but stopped short of pledging money to support them.
The G8 leaders raised the possibility that multilateral development banks could provide more than $20 billion to support reforms in Egypt and Tunisia, where popular uprisings dislodged authoritarian rulers.
French President Nicolas Sarkozy said the amount of aid could reach $40 billion. In addition to the possible $20 billion, he cites about $10 billion in bilateral commitments not mentioned in the G8 summit's communique and $10 billion in contributions from Gulf Arab states such as Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Kuwait.
"The changes under way in the Middle East and North Africa are historic and have the potential to open the door to the kind of transformation that occurred in Central and Eastern Europe after the fall of the Berlin Wall," the G8 leaders said in a statement.

"The aspiration of people for freedom, human rights, democracy, job opportunities, empowerment and dignity, has led them to take control of their own destinies in a growing number of countries in the region."
The G8 is made up of the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan, Italy, Canada, and Russia. They meet regularly to coordinate actions on a range of issues. The United States will host the annual G8 meeting next year.

In a statement, the G8 unveiled an initiative called the Deauville Partnership -- named for the city in France where the leaders met. It seeks to address the Arab Spring, the wave of anti-government demonstrations that started in Tunisia and have since roiled several countries in the Middle East and North Africa, including Egypt, Syria, Yemen and Bahrain.
The partnership focuses on political reform and economic growth.
"We met with the prime ministers of Egypt and Tunisia, and decided to launch an enduring partnership with those countries engaging in a transition to democracy and tolerant societies," the G8 leaders said. "Our common goal is to develop the rule of law and citizen engagement as well as foster economic and social reforms to meet the aspirations of the people."

The partnership hopes to generate economic transition and integration into the regional and global economy. The G8 leaders asked senior foreign and finance ministries to meet in coming months to forge a framework for the effort.
"While Egypt and Tunisia registered economic growth over the past decade, these gains were not widely disbursed. Over the medium and long term, the United States and other members of the G8 commit to support partnership countries in addressing underlying economic challenges in order to broaden economic opportunity," the G8 said.
The group also intends to help Egypt and Tunisia recover stolen assets, and it praised the work of both countries to present their economic plans of actions to international donors.
The group also focused on creating "the political space for democracy" and promoting freedom of expression. It is also committed to tackling illiteracy and unemployment .
